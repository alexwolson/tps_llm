Epstein. On April 13, 2021, the Independent Civilian Review into Missing Person Investigations released its report entitled “Missing and Missed” (Report). The Report contained 151 recommendations designed to improve the Service's policies, procedures, training, education, professional development, and culture. Fifty of the 151 recommendations Recommendation:This report recommendsthat the Board receives this report for information.Financial Implications:There are no financial implications arising from the recommendation contained in this report.\f2were specific to the Homicide and Missing Persons Unit (formerly Missing Persons Unit). Of the 50recommendations, 26have been fully implemented, 24are in progress(4 are completed andawaiting implementation; 4 are80%-99% done; 14 are 20%-79% done and 2 are less than 20% done).(NOTE: Accurate as of May 10, 2024)The review underscored the need for a cultural shift within the organization, prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of missing persons. To this end, the Toronto Police Service Board amended the Missing Persons section of the Adequacy Standards Compliance Policy to ensure that the Chief of Police will follow the steps outlined in regards to missing person investigations. The Missing Person section of the Policy outlines guiding principles, purpose, investigative steps, response assessment, handling of missing children and youth investigations, social supports, public awareness and engagement, and reporting.The Service is committed to co-designing, co-developing and ultimately co-delivering a consensus-building approach to the implementation and operationalization of those recommendations that we believe we can and should act on (more particulars of this are provided later in this report).As such, implementation follows a community-centric approachandis guided by the Missing and Missed Implementation Team, comprised of community and police representatives. Through this approach the Service will endeavour to provide for community engagement and transparency,and to build trust.Changes within Homicide and Missing Persons Unit In April 2022, the Homicide Unit changed its name to the Homicideand Missing Persons Unitin order to support the Service's overall plan to heighten the priority of missing person investigations. Throughout 2022 and 2023,the Homicideand Missing Persons Unitexpanded from four (4) Detective Constables and one (1) Detective to sixteen (16)members,includingeight (8) Detective Constables, one (1) Detective, one (1) Staff Sergeant, one (1) civilian Crime Analyst, one (1) civilian Administrator, and four (4) civilian Missing Persons Coordinators. Mandate Changes During this period of restructuring, the Homicideand Missing Persons Unitalso updated its mandate. The Homicideand Missing Persons Unitis now available 24 hours a day, with an on-call component, to provide continuous support and guidance to divisions regarding missing person investigations and areavailable to be deployed during heightened response calls. In addition, the Homicideand Missing Persons Unitnow monitors and reviews every missing person report to ensure that each call is appropriately responded to. All of this has been reflected in the updated Homicideand Missing Persons Unitmandate that was published in December 2022.Procedural and Process Changes In May 2023, the Toronto Police Service Standards of Conduct was amended to address the appropriate handling of information regarding apotential connection between a Toronto investigation and one of another jurisdiction.\f3In June 2023, while those missing under the age of 12 are already assigned priority with a “Missing Child”event type, a new high priority event type \"Missing Suspicious\", was created to automatically assign a higher response level if it is suspected that a missing person’s disappearance may be related to a criminal offence.The Missing Persons Procedure 04-05 was amended in March 2024 to include changes to the process of reportingand searching for missing persons. Officers are required to accept calls in all instances from dispatchers at Communication Services at the time they are made and give full consideration and attention regardless of where the missing person resides, or where the reportee resides.The Service also revised its memorandum book in March 2024 to include a “Missing Persons Response Reminder Checklist”. The checklist provides members with key steps to take when responding to a missing person call for service. A Routine Order for the revised memorandum book was issued on March 28, 2024, which included a reminder to members that “missing person occurrences are a high risk area of policing and, from the outset, must be given appropriate levels of priorityand resources. Time is critical in high risk cases. It is safer to assume a case is high risk until proven otherwise”. A Service-wide communication (eUpdate) was also sent on April 8, 2024 to Service members to inform of the new reminders added to the memorandum books. In 2022 and 2023,the Toronto Police ServiceMajor Case Management section created additional Detective Constable and civilian PowerCase indexing positons. In addition to the new positions, a training environment was funded and created within Toronto Police Service Headquarters called the Major Case ManagementPowerCase Lab, this is a small training environment to train Specialized Criminal investigationsmembers including members of the Missing Persons Unit on PowerCase.Further to the initial integration of Detective Constable PowerCase Indexers onto the respective teams, the Major Case Managementsection was allotted additional Detective Constable and civilian positions to complete the approved expansion in2023 and 2024. Although the Major Case Managementsection did not foresee all vacancies filled in one calendar year due to the requirements and the length of time for training and PowerCase certification, the selection of candidates will continue into 2024 and 2025.Once candidates are identified and trained, they will be placed accordingly into units in compliance with theprinciples and practices of Major Case Managementlegislation.This expansion will include the Missing Persons Unit.Alignment with Other Services and Collaboration with Other Services The Service has changedits levels of search in a Missing Person investigations to align them with high priority calls for service as well as with the search levels used by neighbouring police services. Prior to this change, a Level 3 search was considered a high priority search and a Level 1 search was considered a low priority search. The change to Level 1 being a high priority search and Level 3 being a low priority search is also consistent with the level of priority assigned toa missing person call when it is generated. This change is also aligned with the search level definitions used by neighbouring police services. \f4Increased Awareness Missing Person Awareness Day was established on February 3rdas an annual reminder to continue supporting a culture change in the Service by raising awareness about missing persons within the community. The day aims to educate the public on various aspects of missing person cases and provide essential resources forreporting and understanding these incidents. With the inauguration of the Missing Person Awareness Day on February 3, 2024, information was widely distributed online through multiple posts on various social media channels, a dedicated webpage on the Service’s website, eUpdate to Service members, as well as printed media to ensure widespread access to the information. To maximize outreach, officers from 51 Division distributed printed copies of the guide throughout the day to members of the Church and Wellesley area, providing an opportunity to share information and engage with the 2SLGBTQ+ community. Service members attending various community organizations and businesses were provided with key information to communicate the establishment of February 3rd asthe annual Missing Person Awareness Day.Increased Support and Communication Reinforcing Culture ChangeThe Homicideand Missing Persons Unithas undertaken initiatives to communicate the importance of missing person investigations. These include information sessions at each division where they introduce themselves and let Service members know that they are available to support them in missing person investigations 24/7. Some of thetopics covered include the Homicideand Missing Persons Unitmandate, information gathering, and intersectionality. A full list of the topics covered can be found in the “Missing Persons Divisional Session Outline” document.(Attached for reference)On March 14th, 2024, an email was sent to all Unit Commanders toadvise them of the changes to the Missing Persons Procedure 04-05 that came into effect on March 20th2024. This communication was followed up with a parade note (a daily briefing to all officers), the issuance of two Routine Orders, an eUpdate that included a video, and an internal webpage article to emphasize the importance of missing person investigations. One of the key changes that was mentioned was the “presumptive high-risk status” of all missing person investigations. The email stated, “All missingperson cases will now be treated with a presumptive high-risk status. This ensures swift allocation of resources and immediate action, prioritizing the safety of individuals reported missing. Now each case will be approached with the utmost urgency and resources allocated accordingly –unless and until a comprehensive risk assessment or other pertinent information suggests otherwise”. Unit Commanders disseminated this information to members of their divisions,to communicate to the field the importance of missing person investigations. The Homicideand Missing Persons Unitsupports this major change to Service protocols concerning missing person investigations by having direct conversations with divisional investigators to convey the importance of the work and through directly supporting members with the change by being available to respond to inquiries.\f5Community EngagementThe Service recognizes the important role of external agencies and encourages regular engagement with community partners during missingperson investigations. The Missing Person Coordinators are responsible for maintaining a list of community contacts from social, public health and community agencies and they work to connect officers with the resources available to assist in missing person investigations. Missing Person Coordinators have developed over 185 community contacts since the introduction of this role. Two support workers from Victim Services will be joining the unit in the upcoming months and will bring additional community contacts with them to add to this number.The Service also has developed a partnership with the Missing Children Society of Canada–Child Search Network to bridge the gap for high-risk missing person cases that do not meet the criteria for Amber Alerts. The partnership with the Missing Children Society of Canadaallows for information to be shared among police services and agencies across the country and links community members to police services. In addition to seeking assistance from external agenciesduring investigations, the Homicideand Missing Persons Unitalso collaborates with community organizations to discuss approaches to missing person investigations. The Homicideand Missing Persons Unithas attended community events to bring awareness to particular missing person investigations and to take part in information sharing. For example, in August 2023, the Homicideand Missing Persons Unitattended a community event organized by the Toronto Council Fire in response to a missing vulnerable person from the Barrie area. The Homicideand Missing Persons Unithas also met with a youth group home and a community agency to discuss how to better respond to youth who go missing from group homes. The Missing Person Coordinators are able to reach out to the relevant contact(s) to assist in locating the missing person and provide follow up help, with the goal of preventing this from happening again.Training and Education The Service has introduced additional training aimed at enhancing officerinteractions with the community. One such program is the \"Trauma-informed approach: Trauma-informed interview techniques\" course, designed to equip officers with the necessary skills to engage with individuals emotionally traumatized by a disappearance or the discovery of a deceased person. This training emphasizes sensitivity and empathy in communication, ensuring officers can effectively support individuals during distressing situations. Furthermore, the Canadian Police Knowledge NetworkRisk Assessment Forms training has been implemented to familiarize service members with the new model for missing persons investigations. While its primary focus is on completing risk assessment forms, the training also emphasizes the importance of inclusivity, raising awareness among officers about diverse perspectives and ensuring equitable treatment in missing persons cases. Through these training programs, the Toronto Police Service aims to foster a more compassionate and effective approach to community interactions and missing person investigations alike.\f6Equity AnalysisSince 2018 the average hours to locate a missing person has dropped significantly.YearHours 20181,8032019776202011832021535202231020232752024134Since 2018 there has been a 92.5% reduction in time taken to locate a missing person.There were 5,331 Missing Person reports in 2023 and 1,668 to date in 2024.The average length of time it takes people to report someone missing has dropped by 30% over the last 2 years. This decrease in the time people take to report someone missing is likely due in part to the information being shared by the Homicideand Missing Persons Unitto members of the community, as well as our engagement on social media dispelling common myths about a waiting period before reporting a missing person. The drop in time allows officers to investigate the matter much closer to thetime someone goes missing and reduces the chance of key evidence such as video, from being lost or erased.Missing Person Occurrences (Reports)%Located 20214,51092%20224,82692%20235,33190%2024 (Year to Date)(January –May 9)1,66888%It should be noted that on average, about 8% of our missing people are located but not captured in the statistics due to an error in reporting. Reminders on common \f7deficiencies and audits of reports are being conducted to educate and correct these errors.Conclusion:The changes the Toronto Police Servicehas made to how missing people are investigated has dramatically reduced the time it has taken to locate missing people and the impact totheir loved ones and the community.We continue to focus on engaging in meaningful relationship-building and engagement with our Community Representatives, while incorporating thoughtful feedback from our Community Representatives as we work to implement the 151 recommendations.Staff Superintendents Pauline Gray and Joe Matthews will be in attendance to answer any questions that the Board may have regarding this report.

TheService engaged an external Employment and Healthy Workplace Specialist,who served as an advisor onthe design and led the evaluation of the updated promotional processesfor the Sergeant and Staff Sergeant ranks. This socio demographic information related to this promotional process evaluation was summarized in theJune 2024 Board Report titled: 2023 Annual People Report: Recruitment, Appointments and Promotions, Secondments, Secondary Activities and Cumulative Legal Costs for Labour Relations Counsel and Legal Indemnification.Discussion:BackgroundThe design and administration of promotional processes have been an ongoing discussion and focus area for the Servicein the last number of years. Fair and Recommendation:It is recommended that the Toronto Police Service Board (Board) receive thisreport. \f2transparent human resource processes are critical to member trust, sound labour relations and community confidence.In accordance with acommitment to continuous improvement, the 2023 PromotionalProcess was designed to be responsive to feedback from members and the community, and to align with key objectives and recommendations set out in the 2020-23 People Plan, Board Policy on Hiring, Recruitment and Promotions (2021), and Missing and Missed ReportRecommendation #122.2.The changes made for the 2023 Promotional Process are the most significant and encompassingthus far made, all donein an effort to enhance member trust. The objective of these changes is to enhance trust through a commitment to increasing objectivity, fairness, transparency, and equity.The Promotional Process has been co-developedby a cross functional design team consisting of Staff Superintendents, People & Culture, with input from several internal and external stakeholders including Equity, Inclusion and Human Rights, LabourRelations, and the Toronto Police Association.Feedback received from working groups established in 2022 and elements of the 2020 Board approved promotional process were also carried forward into this most recent process designsuch as the examination, a competency based application and leadership training requirements.New elements of the process include:∑Interviews were granted on the objective basis of an exam score that was readily known to applicants;∑Interview panel composition focused on achieving a diversity of experiences and backgrounds; ∑Introduction of community members with human resource experienceto support the grading of the candidate applications;∑Design and delivery of evaluation frameworks and training forUnit Commanders, interview panel members and community grading teams on conducting assessments to promote greater evaluation consistency;∑‘Blind’ interview stage where marks from other stages of the process were not known;∑Introduction of robust question management and panelist protocols;∑Enhanced communication of marks to each applicant,as well as transparency on the numberof vacanciesthat would be filled; and∑Socio-demographic data collection for all involved in the process.In 2023, the Service administered the followingtwo uniform promotional processes concurrently:∑Staff Sergeant promotional process:June –December,2023∑Sergeant promotional process: June –November, 2023\f3Both processes included the following steps:1.Multiple Choice Exam 2.Application that included the following elements:a.career summaryb.skills and leadership qualitiesc.community experience 3.Interview made up of senior officer panelistsEighty (80) Sergeants and fifty (50) Staff Sergeants were promoted at the conclusion of these processes.  As part of the Service’s commitment to continuous improvement, acomprehensive post evaluation of this promotional process wasconducted by the independent advisor, Joy Hulton.  Ms. Hulton conducted a series of focus groups and an online survey to ascertain towhat extent the promotional process experience met the Service’s goals and objectivesand reflected the agreed upon Guiding Principles: 1.The Promotional Process is open, transparent, fair, and consistent. 2.Promotions will reflect the diversity and evolving needs of the community. 3.Promotions are based on demonstrated core competencies and values, accomplishments, and learning and development. 4.Promotions are merit based. 5.Successful candidates will be prepared to lead, coach and mentor other members working in our communities. Evaluation participants included successful and unsuccessful candidates as well as Unit Commanders and panelists.  In total, 345 participants (candidates and panelists) provided input through a surveyand86 leaders, candidatesand community representativesprovided input througha series offocus groups.The goal of the evaluation was to assess:•the impact, if any, of key process changes on the experiences and perceptions of fairness, transparency, equity for participants;  •the effectiveness of changes in addressing issues identified in past promotional processes; •the impact on overall marks of the scoring and weight given to each component in the process, against the Guiding Principles for the Promotional Process;•the effectiveness of the training and support given to Interview Panelists and candidates; and •the effectiveness of providing accurate and timely information to all participants, and impact if any on building trust in the process and enhancing transparency and fairness.\f4The following table summarizes both positive aspects as well as areas for improvement. Positive FeedbackAreas for Improvement∑overall greater perception of fairness as a result of the process changes∑opportunity for candidates to showcase their experience and readiness for promotion∑exam location, selection of exam dates, as well as the use of automated marks and question distribution ∑participation of community members seen as value-add∑use of automated scoring and matrices on the application∑greater transparency of points and assessments in the application and interview∑interview locationand prep-time∑elimination of discretionary marks and consensus style interview scoring∑distribution and rotation of questions∑training was helpful ∑process timeline was too long∑communication timeliness and clarity of eligibility ∑greater input from Unit Commanders on readiness∑difference between exam marks (passing vscut-off for interview) was perceived as changing the requirements mid-process.  In addition exam mark alone should not be the only factor in determining interview eligibility.∑modernize exam questions∑uncertainty around impact of community member scoring∑application did not allow equal recognition of all experiences∑interview questions were wordy, not always clear and may not have allowed panelists and candidates to fully demonstrate readiness ∑more training for all participants∑more streamlined debrief processIn addition to the areas for improvement above, four overarching recommendations have been made to refine the promotional process further:•Process map the entire promotional process and support implementation through effective and timely communication of dates and timelines established for each component.•Leverage technology to automate the application and enhance transparency of scoring. •Ensure the promotional process is aligned with and reflective of performance appraisals and career development (and deployment) across the organization. •Educate and support leaders to understand and apply T.P.S.values and the expectations for leaders.\f5Financial Implications:There are no financial implications arising from the information shared in this report.Should any resourcing implications arise from refining the process further, they will be first addressed within the existing 2024 approved operating budget, followed by inclusion into the 2025 operating budget request if required. Conclusion:The Process Evaluation Report attached providesan independent review on the 2023 Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotional processes.  These processes underwent significant changes to enhance their objectivity, consistency and fairness.  The evaluation findings, insights and recommendations will inform future promotional processes.  The Service remains steadfast in its commitment to continuous improvement to develop sector leading, best-in-class, people processes that are fair, equitable and transparent. Ms. Svina Dhaliwal, Chief Administrative Officer, will be in attendance to respond to any questions that the Board may have in regard to this report.Respectfully submitted,Myron Demkiw, M.O.M.Chief of PoliceAttachments:2023 Promotional Process Evaluation \f   PROCESS EVALUATION REPORT Toronto Police Service Joy Hulton, Third Party Advisor Hulton Workplace Resolution May 14, 2024  2023 Sergeant and Staff Sergeant Promotional Process  \f1 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   Executive Summary  In 2023, Toronto Police Service undertook a redesign of the promotional process and implemented the updated process for promotions to the rank of Sergeant and Staff Sergeant. Changes to the promotional process were designed to be responsive to feedback from members and stakeholders about past processes, and to align with key objectives and recommendations set out in foundational Toronto Police Service documents, including: • 2020-23 People Plan • TPSB Policy on Hiring, Recruitment and Promotions (2021) • MMIT Recommendation #122.2  The 2023 Promotional Process built on changes implemented in 2021. The design of the process also sought to incorporate best practices in police promotions from across the sector. I was engaged as a third-party advisor to provide guidance during the design, and to review and evaluate the promotional process to inform continuous improvement for future promotions.  This Report provides a third-party evaluation of the 2023 Promotional Process based on three key questions: 1. Does the new Promotional Process meet the goals and objectives identified in the Guiding Principles?   2. Do participants have greater trust in the fairness and transparency of the process?  3. Are there barriers and/or inequities for some members to fully participate in the process on an equitable basis? Are there areas of bias?  This Report provides an evaluation of the design and implementation of the 2023 Sergeant and Staff Sergeant Promotional Process. It is not an evaluation of outcomes. Toronto Police Service should conduct an outcome evaluation to assess outcomes of the promotional process to determine if the Guiding Principles of promoting to reflect the diversity and evolving needs of the community and identifying and promoting future leaders who will be prepared to lead, coach and mentor other members working in our communities were realized.  Evaluation – Findings   Based on a review of the 2023 process, including information gathered through participant feedback, debriefs with stakeholders and subject matter experts, and a review of the overall scores in the Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotions, the three key evaluation questions are answered as follows: 1. Does the new Promotional Process reflect the goals and objectives identified in the Guiding Principles?  The 2023 process reflects the core principles of fairness, transparency, and consistency in its design, and it achieves the objective of delivering a competency and merit-based process. \f2 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   Enhancements to communication about the process and continuous improvements in the Application and Interview moving forward will enhance the experience of fairness and transparency for participants.    Based on analysis of the overall scores for Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotions in 2023, the distribution of marks and weighting in the overall eligibility determination (20% Exam – 50% Application – 30% Interview) represents an appropriate balance of objective and subjective elements that supports outcomes that are consistent with the Guiding Principles.   A determination of whether successful candidates will be prepared to lead, coach and mentor other members working in our communities can only be made through an outcome evaluation.  2. Do participants have greater trust in the fairness and transparency of the process? Overall, participants experienced a greater sense of fairness in the 2023 process compared to the past. Participants recognized elements of transparency and fairness introduced in the Application and Interview, including the application of standardized scoring matrices and the elimination of discretionary marks.  Gaps in communication that arose during the 2023 promotional process caused some candidates to experience a lack of trust in the process.  Trust and confidence in the process can be built and supported through enhanced communication and training.  3. Are there barriers and/or inequities for some members to fully participate in the process on an equitable basis? Are there areas of bias?  The existence and extent of any barriers and/or inequities can only be fully evaluated through an assessment of outcomes. Equity was enhanced through design elements that provided greater consistency and less discretion in the evaluation of candidates.   The Application form should be reviewed to ensure that the experience of all candidates is evaluated fairly and consistently, in a manner that reflects TPS core values and competencies for leaders.  The 2023 process was designed to remove elements of discretion and bias present in past processes. 75% of candidates who responded to the survey reported that they did not experience or perceive bias, unconscious or conscious, in the process. The experience of bias that was reported related to the scores given for different types of policing experience in the Application. There was no correlation to any sociodemographic factors. Toronto Police Service collected sociodemographic data from candidates and can assess that data against outcomes from the Promotional Process to evaluate the experience of equity/bias based on those factors.  Conclusion  Toronto Police Service committed to making substantive changes to the promotional process to achieve the goals set out in the Guiding Principles, informed by feedback from members and other stakeholders. This Process Evaluation has demonstrated that the changes implemented in 2023 had a positive impact in making the promotional process fairer, more consistent and \f3 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   transparent, and more equitable. The promotional process has been designed to be firmly grounded in Toronto Police Service core competencies and values. Improvements to the process will move it closer to achieving these principles.  To support continued progress towards the goals and objectives of a fair, transparent, equitable, and merit-based promotional process, TPS must ensure that senior leaders and leaders at all levels of the organization understand and are aligned with the current values, competencies, and expectations of leaders and leadership, and that evaluation of candidates reflect those standards and expectations. This may require further development and education/training of leaders at all levels. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \f4 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   Toronto Police Service – 2023 Sergeant and Staff Sergeant Promotions – Process Evaluation 1. Process Evaluation  A Process Evaluation identifies what worked well, what did not work as expected, and what could or should be done differently, to inform process improvements in the short and long term. The Process Evaluation will help Toronto Police Service (TPS) improve the promotional process by assessing feedback on the experience of participants in the 2023 promotions to inform recommendations for continuous improvement.  The goals of the evaluation of the promotional process are to review and evaluate: a) The impact, if any, of key process changes on the experiences and perceptions of fairness, transparency, equity for panelists. (b) The effectiveness of changes in addressing issues identified in past Promotional Processes, including, but not limited to: o interview results heavily weighted by discretion of panel members; o scoring of interviews not transparent; o lack of confidence in security and fairness of interview process (questions); and o lack of meaningful debrief provided to unsuccessful candidates to explain results. (c) The impact on overall marks of the scoring and weighting in the Interview and weight given to each component in the overall score, against the Guiding Principles for the Promotional Process. (d) The effectiveness of the training and support given to Interview Panelists and candidates. (e) Communication provided prior to, during, and after the process to measure effectiveness of providing accurate and timely information to all participants, and impact if any on building trust in the process and enhancing transparency and fairness.  This Report provides a third-party evaluation of the 2023 Promotional Process based on three key questions: 1. Does the new Promotional Process meet the goals and objectives identified in the Guiding Principles?   2. Do participants have greater trust in the fairness and transparency of the process?  3. Are there barriers and/or inequities for some members to fully participate in the process on an equitable basis? Are there areas of bias?  Outcome Evaluation An Outcome Evaluation measures the effects of a process on outcomes based on established criteria. Toronto Police Service should conduct an outcome evaluation to assess outcomes of the promotional process to determine if the Guiding Principles of promoting reflecting the diversity and evolving needs of the community and identifying and promoting future leaders who will be \f5 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   prepared to lead, coach and mentor other members working in our communities were realized. The outcomes cannot be fully evaluated until the results of the Promotional Process have been implemented and successful candidates can be assessed against the stated goals.  While overall scores from the Sergeant and Staff Sergeants promotions were reviewed and analyzed to inform this Process Evaluation, this report does not provide an Outcome Evaluation. 2. Evaluation Criteria - Promotional Process Guiding Principles  During the design of the 2023 Promotional Process, Toronto Police Service adopted a set of guiding principles. They are the criteria for evaluation of the 2023 Sergeant process and outcomes:  1. The Promotional Process is open, transparent, fair, and consistent. 2. Promotions will reflect the diversity and evolving needs of the community. 3. Promotions are based on demonstrated core competencies and values, accomplishments, and learning and development. 4. Promotions are merit based. 5. Successful candidates will be prepared to lead, coach and mentor other members working in our communities.   3. Promotional Process - Design   (a) Design Elements The following design elements were implemented in 2023 Promotional Process to address issues in past process and support the guiding principles: 1. Participants achieving or exceeding the cut-off were granted an Interview provided they met the minimum qualifications.  2. Application was scored in parts with community input (Rationale and Competencies) and Unit Commander assessment (Skills and Leadership). 3. Limited number of interview panels for each rank. All panel members were trained on scoring guide and fairness and equity principles 4. Interview panelists were not provided with Exam or Application scores and are to score the Interview only. 5. Panels scored Interview questions using a standard scoring matrix. No discretionary marks. 6. All unsuccessful candidates were offered debriefs.  7. Weighting of scores to determine Eligibility:  i. Exam    20%   ii. Application - 50%  iii. Interview  30 % 8.  Staff Superintendents signed off Sergeant and Staff Sergeant Applications.     \f6 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation     (b) Fairness and Transparency To implement the guiding principles, the design team committed to several measures designed to promote fairness and transparency: 1. Members will be provided with a fulsome description of all elements of the promotional process, including scoring. 2. All participants are required to sign a Participant Agreement. 3. All elements of the process will be considered from an equity lens, and with principles of procedural fairness to enhance fairness and eliminate the potential for bias. 4. Scoring matrixes to be used to enhance fairness and consistency.  5. Fairness and transparency are built into all components of the process. 6. Enhanced safeguards for exam and interview questions to ensure fairness. 7. Information on outcomes at all stages to be communicated to members.     (c) Overall Marks – Eligibility for Promotion  The 2023 Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotions introduced a new scoring system with assigned scoring and weighting for each component to determine eligibility for promotion. These were developed by the design team in consultation with senior leaders.     4.  Evaluation  (a) Methodology For the purposes of the Process Evaluation, feedback was obtained through: ExamMinimum mark of 85% to qualifyMust meet or exceed cut-off mark to proceed to application and interview 20% of overall markApplicationRationale and Competencies Career Summary and AccreditationSkills, Leadership,  Community Impact  and Unit Commander Assessment  50%-overall markInterviewAll qualified members meeting cut-off mark will be interviewedBehavioural and situational questionsQuality assurance for consistency and fairness30% of overall mark\f7 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   ✓ Surveys and focus groups with all participants (candidates and evaluators) to evaluate process elements and identify areas requiring adjustment. ✓ Review of feedback received (including questions posed) during the 2023 process.  ✓ Debriefs with the Toronto Police Association, senior officers, and internal subject matter experts and design team members. The Process Evaluation is also informed by:  ✓ A review of key changes and design decisions to determine if issues identified in past processes have been sufficiently and appropriately addressed. ✓ Review of Promotional Process results (Exam – Application – Interview and overall marks) to assess outcomes measured against stated objectives. ✓ Review of process elements with subject matter experts.   (b) Collecting Feedback Feedback was collected from all participants in the Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotional process through a series of focus groups with standard questions and open forum discussion. A total of nine focus groups were conducted with: 1. Grading Teams – Community Representatives (1) 2. Grading Teams – Inspectors (1) 3. Sergeant Interview Panels (1) 4. Staff Sergeant Interview Panels (1) 5. Unit Commanders (2) 6. Candidates (3) Participants provided feedback on each component of the promotional process, including:  • Eligibility • Exam • Application • Interview • Debrief • Training  Focus group participants were very engaged in the review process and provided fulsome, constructive comments and consideration of what worked well and what should be improved to enhance fairness, equity, transparency, and consistency.  Data and feedback were also obtained through two online surveys, one for evaluators and one for candidates. The online surveys were open from February 12-27. In total, 319 candidates (51% response) and 26 evaluators responded to the surveys. Of the 319 respondents:  • 152 respondents had been invited to apply and moved on in the promotional process • 166 respondents did not meet the cutoff mark and were not invited to apply • 135 of the 152 respondents who had been invited to apply answered the full survey • 76 of the respondents were successful in promotion and 59 were not successful • 73 respondents provided comments on how the process could be improved • 39 respondents provided additional comments when invited to in the survey \f8 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation     (c) Participant Feedback – Summary  Below is a summary of the most common themes and comments derived from the focus groups and surveys of candidates and evaluators: (i) Overall Process • The entire process extended from May- November and was too long and onerous for candidates.   • Delays between steps in the process with gaps in communication to participants resulted in many candidates feeling that transparency was lacking and caused some to experience a lack of trust in the process.  • Participants acknowledged that many of the changes made to the process enhanced fairness. More communication about these changes would increase the participants’ experience of the process as transparent and fair.  • Candidates recognized and appreciated that they were given a chance to showcase their experience and readiness for promotion which has not been the case in the past.   • 30% of survey respondents reported not having the information needed to help them decide whether to rewrite the Exam.  • Unit Commanders recognize that things needed to change but would like to have more input into determining eligibility of their members for promotion than what they had in the 2023 process.   (ii) Eligibility • The most concerning issue for candidates and Unit Commanders was the introduction of a cutoff mark which exceeded the 85% exam passing mark. There was a perception that TPS changed the requirements after the process began, which undermined trust and confidence.   • Most participants acknowledge that TPS cannot interview everyone and there needs to be a cut-off but overwhelmingly they do not support having the Exam mark alone determine who moves on.   • The cutoff mark, regardless of how it is determined, needs to be clearly established and communicated to members before the process starts.  • Unit Commanders support changes made for transparency and consistency, but most want to have more input into determining eligibility for promotion than they did in the 2023 process.   \f9 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   (iii) Exam • The location of the exam (Toronto Police College) and the ability for members to the select their exam date were positive elements.   • Members would like to see exams offered multiple times during the year so they can plan for preparation and schedule their exam and preparation in advance.  • Members describe the Exam preparation as very onerous, however, 80% of survey respondents reported having sufficient time to prepare.  • Candidates and Unit Commanders feel the Exam should be modernized so that it tests the application of knowledge as a supervisor rather than just memorization of procedures. TPS members can access procedures electronically and no longer need to memorize them, so the Exam questions seem outdated.   • Use of the online format with automated marks enhanced the sense of fairness and transparency.  • Random distribution of questions enhances fairness, but the way questions are distributed needs to be reviewed to ensure all members write the “same” exam.  (iv) Application  • Candidates appreciated the opportunity to ‘showcase’ their experience in the Application.  • 95% of survey respondents reported having sufficient time to complete the Application.   • Involvement of community members offered an element of community input as committed to by TPS but lack of transparency about how community representatives were selected and the extent of their impact on the overall scoring caused some concern for fairness and lack of transparency.  • Grading team members (Inspectors and community members) see value in the participation of community members, but they need to be better supported through training and education if they are to be involved in this process.  • 52% of candidates who responded to the survey reported that the Application did not give them sufficient opportunity to fully demonstrate their skills, abilities, and readiness for promotion largely due to the limits in the word count in Parts 1 (Rationale) and 3 (Competencies) and the limited content in options in (Parts 4 and 5) which did not allow all candidates to have their experience recognized equally.   • Some candidates expressed a belief that the scoring in Parts 4 and 5 favours investigative experience, while others feel it favours community-based experience.   \f10 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   • Candidates report that fairness and transparency were achieved to some degree (much more than in the past) in the Application through use of automated scoring and scoring matrices. Candidates would like to know the scoring matrix for the Competencies and UC assessment sections.  • Candidates and evaluators experienced technical difficulties because the Application form was in a pdf format.  These challenges can be overcome if the form is automated.  • Candidates report that there is more fairness in the process because the Unit Commander assessment is more transparent. The fairness and transparency of the assessment would be enhanced if the process is standardized. Unit Commanders should be required to reflect input from their leadership teams in their assessment of each candidate.   • Candidates want to receive their graded Application before moving on to the Interview, so they know if they applied the STAR-L model properly. (v) Interview • Process changes such as daily rotation of panels and questions and the use of standard scoring matrices made the interview fairer and more transparent.  • Toronto Police College is a good location for the interviews. • Candidates benefited from and appreciated the 30-minute preparation time prior to their interview.  • Interview process was also fairer and more transparent because of the elimination of discretionary marks.  • Panels were able to reach consensus using the matrices and all opinions were considered and reflected in the scores.  • Participants found many of the behavioural questions ‘wordy’ and confusing and the language was not consistent with police operations. Many candidates and panelists were not always clear about what was being asked.  • Panelists and candidates felt that many of the behavioural questions did not allow candidates to demonstrate their supervisory or leadership skills in part because they were very general in nature. They would like to see the mix of behavioural and situational questions reviewed.  • Scoring matrix created more fairness and transparency but candidates would like to know the matrix in advance to understand how questions will be scored.  • Random distribution of questions enhances fairness, but it should be in a manner that ensures a consistent mix of the nature and themes of questions for all candidates.  \f11 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   (vi) Training • 94% of candidates participated in the training (38% in person and 62% by video). 63% of candidates found the training helped them prepare for the interview. 55% found training helped them complete the Application.  • Candidates feel they need more training before completing the Application and more substantive training to fully understand how to apply the STAR-L model.  • Community Representatives require more training and support to fulfill their role on the grading teams.   • Trainees would benefit from more mock questions with the opportunity for feedback from trainers, and access to a video of a mock interview.  • Unit Commanders and mentors require training on the entire process to support members properly and accurately.   (vii) Debriefs • 30% of survey respondents requested a debrief. 70% found the debrief somewhat helpful or helpful. Candidates would like to receive a breakdown of their Application scores, so they understand how they scored and what they need to improve.  • Candidates would like to receive their Application score prior to the Interview so they have feedback on their understanding and application of the STAR-L model.   • Unit Commanders could not fully debrief candidates because they did not have debrief notes from the entire process or the breakdown of how each candidate scored on the Application. The debrief process was cumbersome because candidates had to go to different sources for additional debrief which is a cumbersome process.   (viii) Fairness and Transparency Survey respondents were asked to rate their experience and perception of fairness and transparency in the 2023 process. Most survey respondents commented that the lack of clear and timely communication resulted in a perception of a lack of transparency for many members which undermined their trust and confidence in the process. Participants acknowledged that many of the new design elements enhanced fairness for candidates, particularly the use of scoring matrices but these measures should be shared with members in a more transparent manner. The detailed breakdown of their perception and experience of fairness and transparency is below: Q. The Toronto Police Services Board Policy for Recruitment, Appointments and Promotions for Uniform and Civilian Members of Toronto Police Service requires that the promotion process must \f12 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   be transparent, consistent, and procedurally fair to all involved.  Please rate your experience of fairness in the 2023 process:     Not Fair Fair Very Fair Average (1-3) Exam 10.16% 39.84% 50% 2.4 Application – Parts 1, 2, 3 31.30% 54.20% 14.50% 1.83 Application – Parts 4 and 5 51.85% 38.52% 9.63% 1.58 Application – Part 6 30.53% 51.15% 18.32% 1.88 Interview 23.48% 49.24% 27.27% 2.04  (ix) Equity and Bias Survey participants were also asked about their experience and perception of equity and bias in the 2023 process. Candidates noted that they cannot fully assess equity or bias without knowing the breakdown of their scores. Some expressed a sense of bias in how their own police experience was valued and scored in Parts 4 and 5 of the Application. The survey results for the experiences of equity and bias are below: Q.  The Board Policy on Recruitment, Appointments and Promotion also requires that the process apply an equity lens to eliminate potential for bias including unconscious bias. Did you experience or perceive any bias, conscious or unconscious, in the 2023 promotional process?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \f13 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation    Q. As an organization, Toronto Police Service understands ‘equity’ as fair treatment and access to opportunities for everyone. This doe does not mean treating everyone the same. Equity recognizes that people have different needs and experience different barriers, so they may need different supports to access certain opportunities.

Evaluation – Findings   Based on a review of the participant feedback, debriefs with stakeholders and subject matter experts, and a review of the overall scores in the Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotions, the three key questions in the Process Evaluation are answered as follows: YesNo0.00%20.00%40.00%60.00%80.00%Responses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \f14 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   1. Does the new Promotional Process reflect the goals and objectives identified in the Guiding Principles?  The 2023 process reflects the core principles of fairness, transparency, and consistency in its design, and it achieves the objective of delivering a competency and merit-based process. Enhancements to communication about the process and continuous improvements in the Application and Interview moving forward will enhance the experience of fairness and transparency for participants.    Based on analysis of the overall scores for Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotions in 2023, the distribution of marks and weighting in the overall eligibility determination (20% Exam – 50% Application – 30% Interview) represents an appropriate balance of objective and subjective elements that supports outcomes that are consistent with the Guiding Principles.   A determination of whether successful candidates will be prepared to lead, coach and mentor other members working in our communities can only be made through an outcome evaluation.  2. Do participants have greater trust in the fairness and transparency of the process? Overall, participants experienced a greater sense of fairness in the 2023 process compared to the past. Participants recognized elements of transparency and fairness introduced in the Application and Interview, including the application of standardized scoring matrices and the elimination of discretionary marks.  Gaps in communication that arose during the 2023 promotional process caused some candidates to experience a lack of trust in the process.  Trust and confidence in the process can be built and supported through enhanced communication and training.  3. Are there barriers and/or inequities for some members to fully participate in the process on an equitable basis? Are there areas of bias? The existence and extent of any barriers and/or inequities can only be fully evaluated through an assessment of outcomes. Equity was enhanced through design elements that provided greater consistency and less discretion in the evaluation of candidates.  The Application form should be reviewed to ensure that the experience of all candidates is evaluated fairly and consistently, in a manner that reflects TPS core values and competencies for leaders.  The 2023 process was designed to remove elements of discretion or bias present in past processes. 75% of candidates reported that they did not experience or perceive bias, unconscious or conscious, in the process. Bias that was reported related to the scores given for different types of policing experience in the Application. 6. Recommendations The Process Evaluation informs a series of recommendations for continuous improvement in the Sergeant and Staff Sergeant Promotional Process. The Recommendations set out in this report have been reviewed with the design team, subject matter experts, and stakeholders within Toronto \f15 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   Police Service including the Toronto Police Association. The Recommendations are provided for consideration and evaluation by Toronto Police Service to determine what, if any, process improvements should be implemented. Several recommendations are already being implemented. Some of the recommendations can be implemented in the short term but others are longer-term and require consultation and consideration.  Below is an overview of key recommendations: 1. Develop and implement a comprehensive communication strategy to support the promotional process.    2. Leverage technology to automate the Application and enhance transparency of scoring.  3. Educate and support leaders to understand and apply TPS values and the expectations for leaders.  4. Ensure the promotional process is aligned with and reflective of performance appraisals and career development (and deployment) across the organization.  5. Review and clarify how eligibility for an Interview is established. 6. Offer Exams, at Toronto Police College, multiple times per year and ensure members have adequate notice of Exams to allow members to schedule preparation time.  7. Ensure random distribution of Exam questions is done equitably so that all members write the ‘same’ (or equivalent) exam. 8. Consider modernizing the Exam to ensure that it assesses candidates’ knowledge of and ability to apply procedures, based on the expectations of supervisors.  9. Improve the Application process by automating the application form and increasing word limits in Parts 1 and 3 of the application form. 10. Review and update Career Development and Additional Duties sections to ensure all areas of experience are recognized and valued fairly and appropriately.  11. Establish clear expectations of Unit Commanders in how to complete the assessment and provided training to Unit Commanders.  12. Review and update Interview questions to enhance clarity and appropriateness from a police operations perspective.  13. Ensure Interview questions are randomly distributed in a consistent manner (even distribution of themes and types of scenarios.) 14. Ensure participants have access to training on the application of the STAR-L model to both the Application form and Interview. 15. Enhance training through access to mock interviews.  16. Ensure mentors receive the same training as provided to candidates/evaluators \f16 | Page Toronto Police Service – 2023 Promotional Process – Process Evaluation   17. Explore opportunities to enhance and streamline the debrief process. Enhance training provided for Community Representatives to ensure they are properly prepared for their role (i.e. more information about police procedure, expectations of officers). 18. Explore options to provide unsuccessful candidates with a more detailed debrief of their scores on the Application so they understand where they need to improve.  7. Organizational Readiness TPS has demonstrated readiness for substantive changes to the promotional process that enhances objectivity and consistency, and many such changes were embraced and implemented in the 2023 Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotions. To support continued progress towards the goals and objectives of a fair, transparent, equitable, and merit-based promotional process, TPS must ensure that senior leaders and leaders at all levels of the organization understand and are aligned with the current values, competencies, and expectations of leaders and leadership, and that evaluation of candidates reflect those standards and expectations. This may require further development and education/training of leaders at all levels.  Any consideration of restoring more influence on the outcomes of promotions at the Unit Commander level requires continuous improvements of the process and the training and readiness of Unit Commanders to engage in an objective, merit-based process, as outlined in this report.    8. Conclusion Toronto Police Service committed to making substantive changes to the promotional process to achieve the goals set out in the Guiding Principles, informed by feedback from members and other stakeholders. This Process Evaluation has demonstrated that the changes implemented in 2023 had a positive impact in making the promotional process fairer, more consistent, and transparent, and more equitable. The promotional process has been designed to be firmly grounded in Toronto Police Service core competencies and values. Improvements to the process will move it closer to achieving these principles.  Further analysis is required to assess the outcomes of the 2023 promotional process to determine if the goal of identifying successful candidates who are prepared to lead, coach and mentor other members, and work with the community has been achieved.  While this report recommends areas for improvement, Toronto Police Service is advised to maintain the principles and key design elements implemented in the 2023 process without significant change to provide continuity and consistency of expectations for candidates and evaluators. If Toronto Police Service makes changes to the promotional process now or in the future, it should ensure that the process is ready for implementation and any changes are fully communicated to the organization before embarking on a round of promotions.

This combined People and Culture Pillar report includes the following annual information for 2023:•new job descriptions that were created for Civilian Service members;•socio-demographic information about applicants and selected candidates in recruitment  and promotional processes•strategies the Service currently employs or intends to employ in order to address any issues or gaps related to recruitment and promotional processes•a list of secondment positions filled by Service members•a summary of applications received from Toronto Police Service members to engage in secondary activities; and•information on the payment of accounts for labour relations counsel and cumulative legal indemnification costs for 2023Financial Implications:This report includes implications related to salary expenses, staffing complement, and costs associated with labour relations counsel, legal indemnification and arbitration.  All costs associated with this report have been incurred in 2023 and any annualization of salary costs have been included in the 2024 budget requests. Both Civilian and Uniform recruitment often draws from existing members, which can result in a reallocation of existing headcount for new positions. Civilian vacancies arefilled by internal recruitment approximately 45.3% of the time, resulting in additional recruitment costs to backfill the role that has been vacated as a result of the internal movement.  New police cadets are hired from existing civilian staff, includingSpecial Constables, Parking Enforcement Officers, and other civilian positions almost 15% of the time, again resulting in the additional costs to recruitment of filling those now vacant civilian positions.Labourrelationscounsel,legalindemnification,and arbitrationcoststotalled approximately $1.03 Million in 2023.  These costs arefundedfromthe Toronto Police Service’s (Service)LegalReserve.The obligation to pay legal indemnification costs is contained in the collective agreements between the Board and the Toronto Police Association (T.P.A.) and Toronto Police Senior Officers’ Organization (S.O.O.), as well as Board Policy.\f4Relevant Board Policies and ComplianceThis report is in response to the following Board policies:At its meeting on September 27, 2021, the Board approved a new Policy entitled “Recruitment, Appointments and Promotions for Uniform and Civilian Members of the Toronto Police Service (Service)”.  The Board requested an annual summary report that is to include:∑a copy of current promotional process(es);∑new job descriptions that were created for Civilian Service members;∑detailed demographic information about applicants applying for, and who are successful in promotions;∑an analysis of trends at every stage of the promotional process, including whether it appears that there may be systemic or other barriers to promotion based on aggregated demographic information, and if so, ∑what strategies the Service intends to employ in order to rectify any potential concerns about the promotional process and/or disparate outcomes for identified groups.This policy was further refined and approved at the Board’s meeting held on March 2, 2023 (Minute No.: P2023-0302-2.0). The revised policy includes the following changes:∑Board approval will be required for appointments and promotions of civiliansenior officers from the classification of Z30 (Manager) and above;∑Recommendations for delegated authority to the Chief or their designate forcertaintypes of promotions and terminations;∑A requirement for consultation where changes to the established promotionalprocess is being contemplated, with an understanding that establishing astandardized promotional process should be completed; and∑Expanding and enhancing the requirements for the Chief’s annual report to theBoard on hiring, promotions and terminations.Also relevant to this report, the Board directed that the Chief of Police report annually on the following:∑secondments of Service members (Minute No P5/01); decisions with respect to Secondary Activities; ∑payments relating to all accounts for labour relations counsel, arbitration fees, legal indemnification claims and accounts relating to inquests which were approved by the Director, People and Culture, and the Manager of Labour Relations (Min. No. P5/01 refers and Min. No. P2021-0729-4.0 refers).\f5Discussion2023 Recruitment, Appointments and PromotionsCivilian HiringIn 2023, 675 full time civilian vacancies were filled, excluding Youth in Policing Initiative (Y.I.P.I.) hires. There were a total of 269 job calls, including those for mass classes.  This represents a 20.1% increase over the number of 2022 civilian job calls (224). Of the 675 full time hires, 35.6% (240) were hired as internal movements/promotions (down from 45.3% or 293 in 2022) and 64.4% (435) were external hires (up from 54.7% or 354 in 2022).In 2023, the following 19 new civilian jobs were created by the Service (Job Descriptions for each found in Appendix A).  Notethat the creation of new civilian jobs doesnot necessarily mean an increase in 2023 or 2024 headcount as there may be internal reallocations to prioritize current resource needs/budget approvals from previous years: S.O.O. -Civilian Senior Officer Positions∑Z36009.3 Chief of Staff, Chief’s Office∑Z32033.3 Manager, Strategic Stakeholder Engagement, Corporate Communications∑Z26033.3 Issues & Media Advisor, Corporate Communications ∑Z26032.3 Lead, Social Media, Corporate Communications TPA -Unit A Position∑A13015.3 Training Standards Lead, Toronto Police College ∑A12027.3 Workplace Investigator, Equity, Inclusion & Human Rights ∑A12026.3 Executive Officer∑A11043.3 EI&HR Training Specialist, Toronto Police College ∑A11042.3 Cyber Threat and Vulnerability Specialist, Information & Technology Command ∑A11041.3 Senior Writer, Corporate Communications ∑A10068.3 Events & Operations Specialist, Corporate Communications ∑A10067.3 Multimedia Specialist, Corporate Communications ∑A10065.3 DNA Administrator, Court Services ∑A08084.4 Group Leader, Court Services ∑A08083.3 Internal Communications Coordinator, Corporate Communications ∑A08082.3 Social Media Coordinator, Corporate Communications ∑A07103.3 Project Support Coordinator, Employee Services ∑A07101.4 Missing Persons Coordinator, Homicide & Missing Persons  ∑A06106.4 Quality Control Clerk, Court Services \f6Cadet HiringIn 2023, the Service received 3,761 distinct applicants for the position of Police Cadet in Training, representing an increase of 11.6% compared to 2022 when there were 3370 distinct applications.  Of these, 2346 candidates did not successfully meet the pre-screening requirements and were automatically screened out by the system.  The remaining applications, in addition to 35 deferred from 2022, were considered in 2023.  The following table summarizes the outcomes of the 1,450 applications considered in 2023.

In addition, 13 applications were deferred for consideration in 2024.Of the successful cadets, almost 15% were internal hires (from other units including but not limited to Parking Enforcement, Court Services and Special Constables)and 85% were external hires. In 2023, 25.8% of new hires learned about the profession through a member referral process. Current member(s) are encouraged to be Ambassadors recognizing people who demonstrate skills, abilities and moral character for the profession.   Socio-demographic data for the cadet hiring processes can be found in Appendix B.  In addition to cadets, the Lateral Experienced Officer Program consists of both officers who had previously worked for the Toronto Police Service and officers who came to the Service as new members. In 2023 there were 27 Lateral Experienced Police Constables hired by the Service; 14 of these lateral hires were considered “TPS Re-Hires”. In 2022 21 Lateral officers were hired.\f7Uniform Promotional Process RedesignThe design and administration of promotional processes have been an ongoing discussion and focus area for the Service in the last number of years. Fair and transparent human resource processes are critical to member trust, sound labour relations and community confidence. In 2023, the Service engaged an external employment and healthy workplace specialist who supported the design, implementation and evaluation of new promotional processes for the Sergeant and Staff Sergeant ranks.  These new processes carried forward elements from the Board approved 2020 promotional process design (Min. Nos. P139/20 refer), such as leadershiptraining requirements, use of exam software and a competency based application.  It also incorporated new elements to enhance fairness, transparency, procedural fairness, and ensure the process was operationally feasible to administer.  Key highlights included:∑Interviews were granted on the objective basis of an exam score that was readily known to applicants;∑Interview panel composition focused on achieving a diversity of experiences and backgrounds; ∑Introduction of community members with human resource experience to support the grading of the candidate applications;∑Design and delivery of evaluation frameworks and training for Unit Commanders, interview panel members and community grading teams on conducting assessments to promote greater evaluation consistency;∑‘Blind’ interview stage where marks from other stages of the process were not known;∑Introduction of robust question management and panelist protocols;∑Enhanced communication of marks to each applicant, as well as transparency on the number of vacancies that would be filled; and∑Socio-demographic data collection for all involved in the process.In 2023, the Service administered the following two uniform promotional processes concurrently:∑Staff Sergeant promotional process: June –December, 2023∑Sergeant promotional process: June –November, 2023Both processes included the following steps:1.Multiple Choice Exam 2.Application that included the following elements:a.career summaryb.skills and leadership qualitiesc.community experience \f83.Interview made up of senior officer panelistsAn independent evaluation of both Sergeant and Staff Sergeant processes was conducted and will be submitted to the Board in a separate report.  Staff SergeantThere were 210 total applicants for the Staff Sergeant promotional process.Based on the exam score cut-off of 91%, 89 applicants or 42% were invited to the application and interview stage.The interviews were held in late November 2023 and were conducted by five panelswhich consisted of Staff Superintendents, Superintendents and Inspectors from across the Service.Scores from each stage were compiled and 50 candidates were selected and placed on the list for promotion.Aggregated socio-demographic data for applicants and successful candidates, as well as the list of new Staff Sergeants for promotion is included in Appendix C.SergeantThere were a total of 418applicants for the 2023 Sergeant promotional process.Based on the exam score cut-off of 90%, 152 applicantswere invited to the interview stage. The skills and leadership section in the application was evaluated by the candidate’s unit commander and reviewed by their respective Staff Superintendent.   The community experience element of the application was evaluated by a grading team made up of at least 1 Inspector and 1 community member. The interviews were held in late October 2023 and were conducted by four panels which consisted of Superintendents and Inspectors from across the Service.Scores from eachstage were compiled and 80 candidates were selected and placed on the list for promotion.Aggregate socio-demographic data for applicants and successful candidates, as well as the list of new Sergeants for promotion is included in Appendix D.\f9Analysis of Trends in Hiring/Promotion and Identification of Systemic BarriersThe Service continues to attract, hire and promote an increasingly diverse workforce at all levels.  Consistently 35 –38% of all external applicants (cadets and civilian roles) self-identify as having a racialized background.  When comparing applicants to the diverse make-up of the city, gaps remain in attracting candidates from specific communities (e.g. Indigenous, Black and East/Southeast Asian communities) and notably female cadet applications remain below pre-pandemic levels.  Talent Acquisition Unit continues to develop strategies that attract more applicants from diverse communities and create opportunities for those applicants to succeed in various processes.The service hired racialized and female cadets at higher proportions than their presence in the applicant pool.  Since 2020 cadet classes have increased in racial diversity by 33 per cent.  The Service has also experienced an increase in female civilian hires across all roles (41.5% in 2022 vs 46% in 2023).Socio-demographic data forcivilians can be found in Appendix E.  From a leadership standpoint, female candidates were more likely to be successful in both Sergeant and Staff Sergeant processes.  Racialized candidates were more likely to be successful in the Sergeant process.  However the data has identified that there remains gaps and disproportionalities at the ranks of Staff Sergeant and above.Of approximately 80 uniform senior officers (including the Deputy Chiefs), 48% belong to at least one historically underrepresented group, compared to 29% in 2018 (accordingto Deloitte’s Workplace Well-being, Harassment and Discrimination Review).  Twenty-three per cent of senior officers are racialized; this compares to 16% in 2018, according to the same Deloitte report.  Twenty-eight per cent of uniform senior officers arewomen, up from 13% in 2018. (Note these numbers cannot be added together as there are female/racialized senior officers and racialized senior officers so would be in both numbers.)While the Service has experienced demonstrable positive results in hiringand promotional trends in recent years, there remains work to be done.These insights allow the Service to focus more upstream in the process, focusing on training and development opportunities, in order to build a resilient and diverse workforce at all ranks of the organization. Current efforts being pursued include: ∑continued community outreach and female-focused cadet recruitment; ∑refinement of the Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotional processes based on the evaluation results∑application of an equity lens towards training and development opportunities;∑organization-wide socio demographic collection in order to establish an overall baseline, understand member career journeys and identify culturally appropriate needs and programming;\f10∑exploring the use of public and private sector partnerships for leadership development.The above efforts is a subset of a broader set of initiatives and work underway as part of building a respectful workplace that is detailed in the Service’s Equity Strategy: The Road to Creating an Inclusive Workplace and Fairness in Community Safety. Recruitment and Hiring InitiativesThe Talent Acquisition Recruitment Teamcontinued taking further steps in 2023 to implement new and expand on current initiatives, to reachToronto’s multicultural communities. Below are the new and expanded upon initiatives implemented to support the organization’s recruitment efforts:Initiative and Program Area2023OngoingNew/ FutureRecruitment and EngagementExpansion of Women’s Only Mentoring ProgramRecruiting initiatives such as Motivational Mondays and the expansion oftheWomen’s Only Mentoring Programand a Fitness Bootcamp are designed to increase the success rate among female applicants. The Service remains committed to prioritizing the recruitment of female cadets.As part of the Fitness Bootcamp, successful participants are given a 6 week periodto apply for theposition of Police Constable and use the Bootcamp results as proof of them passing the physicalfitness requirements for hiring purposes.This program has already seen some success in 2023. Two certificate owners have been hired in 24-01, and 5 are currently in the process of being hired for Class 24-02. There was an overall increase of 21.2% of total women hired from 2022 to 2023. The program will continue to run throughout 2024.XIndigenous Candidate Program –In 2023 anIndigenous Candidate programwas put in placeto proactively seek out potential candidates, while providing information and improving access for further Indigenous community members to become Police Constables. The X\f11Initiative and Program Area2023OngoingNew/ FutureRecruitment and Engagementteam created a partnership with the TPS Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit (APU) and has attended several events together including out of town recruiting events.Internal Support Network (ISN) Videos –The Service’sInternal Support Networks have participated in recruitment activities.  In 2023,in partnership with Corporate Communicationsandthe ISNs, ‘I am Toronto Police’, videos are being developed and will be disseminated through various communication channels. XPlanning of Ontario Police Services Career Fair in support of Women in Policing-A women focused Ontario Police Services Career Fair will be held at the Toronto Police College in June 2024. XSocial Media Expansion and Specialization –From January 3rd2023 to Jan 3rd2024, content from the Recruiting Social pages (Instagram, Facebook & Twitter) cumulatively reached the screens of users over 2.2 million times. This is a 143% increase from the 891,000 impressions during the previous year. Individually, Instagram received 1.7 million impressions (up 209% from previous year), Twitter received 313,000 impressions (up 12.5% from previous year), and Facebook received 191,000 impressions (up 151% from previous year). The average engagement rate for the posts published to Toronto Police recruitment pages in 2023 is 8.06%, a 29.4% increase from 6.23% in 2022. Anengagement rate between 1% and 5% is commonly considered a ‘strong’ positive engagement.  The Service also utilized social media advertising which has reached an extra 28,422 unique accounts for only $212.87 through 2023. This amounts to 1.2 cents per unique account reached –being much more cost effective compared to other advertising methods.XXMentoring Contact Cards –In July 2023 mentoring cards, a new, easy and innovative way for potential candidates to connect with and gain insight from X\f12Initiative and Program Area2023OngoingNew/ FutureRecruitment and Engagementrecruiterswas put in place. The cards includes a QR code which, when scanned, prompts the user to fill out contact information to then be contacted by a member of the team.These mentoring contact cards have also been distributed to all Divisional Neighbourhood Community Officersfor distribution within their communities.As of January 2024 the team has accumulated 420 mentoring contacts, with 121 applicants, 15 confirmed hires including 7female hires.Cadet Feedback Sessions -In 2023 sessions were held with Cadets during theirtraining to provide feedback on the recruitment process.  Their input will help the Service continuously refine the process in order to provide the best possible candidate experience. XXIn addition to the above initiatives, the Recruitment Team attended and hosted 208 events, including a wide array of multicultural events across the Greater Toronto Area and beyond. 2023 Secondment UpdateIn 2023, a total of 55 Service members (48 uniformand 7 civilians) were seconded to various provincial, federal and American partner organizations.  The details of these secondments can be found in Appendix F. Of this total, 35 uniform and 6 civilians were seconded to various agencies at full cost recovery for salaries and benefits to the Service.In addition, for the same time period, 13 uniform and 1 civilian were seconded with no cost recovery to the Service.The unfunded secondment positions include partnerships with federal and provincial government agencies, with both the Service and the partner agencies benefitting from the working relationship. These partnerships are necessary and enable more effective and efficient strategies and action to help address various crime and security issues, which cross national boundaries, as well as create key liaisons with various provincial entities.Secondary ActivitiesSecondary activities performed by members of the Service outside of their employment with the Service are governed by Section 49 of the Police Services Act (P.S.A.) and related Service Procedure.\f13Section 49(1) of the P.S.A. states:49(1)A memberof a police force shall notengagein anyactivity:(a)thatinterfereswithorinfluencesadverselytheperformanceofhisorherdutiesasamember ofthepoliceservice,orislikelytodoso; or(b)thatplaceshimorherinapositionofconflictofinterest,orislikelytodoso; or(c)thatwouldotherwiseconstitutefull-timeemploymentforanotherperson;or(d)inwhichheorshehasanadvantagederivedfromemploymentasamember of apolice force.Pursuant to Service Procedure 14-25, members are required to submit an Application for Secondary Activity on Form TPS 778 for approval by the Chief of Police if the member believes the activity may contravene Section 49(1) of the P.S.A.Service Procedure 14-25 does not outline an exhaustive list of activities which may contravene Section 49(1) of the P.S.A.,and the Chief of Police exercises discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to determine whether an application is likely to contravene the restrictions set. Members whose applications are approved are required to sign an agreement outlining the terms and conditions of approval.

(Hicks Morley) for the provision of supplementary legal services in the area of employment and labour law (Min No. P2021-1123-5.0 refers). 323144111111012345Category2023 Applications for Secondary Activities by Membership and Activity TypeCivilianUniform\f15Legal services provided by Hicks Morley include representing the Board at grievance arbitration, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board and Appeals Tribunal. In addition, Hicks Morley provides legal advice, opinions, draft documents, and case management services in the area of employment and labour law.Legal Indemnification CostsMembers of the Service may be eligible for indemnification for legal costs incurred in respect of particular types of legal proceedings as outlined in the relevant collective agreements and Service Procedure where, amongst other things, a member was acting in the good faith performance of his or her duties. These proceedings include criminal and civil proceedings, Special Investigations Unit investigations, Coroner’s Inquests, and reviews by the Office of the Independent Police Review Director.There are a number of existing parameters and risk management measures in place for legal indemnification claim approvals, including those contained in the collective agreements as well as memoranda of understanding between the T.P.A. and the Board.  The T.P.A. or S.O.O., as appropriate, are responsible for retaining counsel for a member involved in a legal proceeding and for following the application and adjudication process prescribed by the parties.  All legal fees are independently reviewed for reasonableness and necessity by the City Solicitor’s Office and dockets are amendedwhen necessary before indemnification is approved. In addition, hourly rates charged by counsel for members are capped for different types of proceedings.CumulativeSummaryfor2023During the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023, 218 invoices for external labour relations counsel totalling $250,406 were received and approved for payment. Five invoices totalling $13,386 were received and approved for payment to arbitrators presiding over grievances.During the period from January 1 to December 31,2023, 95 accounts from external counsel relating to legal indemnification were paid totalling $764,357, representing the largest component (74%) of the total legal costs incurred for 2023.FortheperiodJanuary1toDecember31,2023,legalcostsincurredforLabourRelations CounselandLegalIndemnificationtotalled$1,028,150as follows:Number of FilesTypeofAccountPaid2023CostsIncurred218Paymentsforlabourrelationscounsel:76 paymentsforlabourrelationscounsel7   paymentsforbargaining(T.P.A.&S.O.O.)135 paymentsforWorkplace Safety and Insurance $141,490$11,924\f16Number of FilesTypeofAccountPaid2023CostsIncurredBoard (W.S.I.B.)casemanagement$96,9925ArbitrationCostsrelatedtoGrievances:paymentsforgrievanceactivity$13,38690LegalIndemnification–Special Investigations Unit(195 officers represented)$439,6240Legal Indemnification –Criminal Injuries Compensation Board$00Legal Indemnification –Third Party Records Application$01Legal Indemnification –Criminal Charges(5 officers represented)$11,4361Legal Indemnification –Office of the Independent Police Review Director(1 officers represented)$6,9783Legal Indemnification –Coroner’s Inquests(8 officers represented)$306,3200Legal Indemnification –CivilActions$0TotalCostsfor2023$1,028,150Five Year TrendTotal legal costs decreased in 2023 due to a decrease in legal indemnification claim volume and amounts, which are variable from year to year.With respect to legal indemnification costs, the variation from year to year is primarily because the number and types of proceedings for which members are eligible for indemnification varies based on the day-to-day operations of the Service. In addition, billing and/or adjudication of the applications for indemnification sometimes crosses over reporting years, occasionally resulting in multiple large files from multiple years being paid in the same year.With respect to costs related to labour relations counsel, there are similar year to year variations in the number and types of grievances, WSIB appeals, and other proceedings which occur in a given year.In 2023, overall legal costs were lower than recent previous years at least partly because costs in recent previous years were driven up by COVID-19 related cases.The following chart illustrates the total legal costs incurred for labour relations counsel and legal indemnification for the years 2019 to 2023:\f17Terminations There are 14 members who were terminated in 2023.There isa confidential attachment with additional information in regarding terminations.In all cases where a member was terminated (or resigned as an alternative) for misconduct, the identified misconduct in each case was deemed serious enough to merit a termination for cause.Equity, Inclusion and Human Rights was consulted in all matters, as appropriate.In the cases in which a member was terminated (or resigned as an alternative) during probation, it was as a result of failure to meet performance standards, following efforts by unit management (including in some instances, Performance Improvement Plans) to assist the member in meeting standards.In all cases, members received representation from the Toronto Police Association or the Senior Officers’ Organization, depending on their role.Summary and Analysis of Exit Survey DataExit surveys were re-introduced to the Service in 2023. The surveys were disseminated to 132 individuals, including retirees; 54 members responded. The table below lists the topreasons that contributed to the separation.

Therefore, any “contributed to” responses that were below 20% have been excluded from this chart. People & Culture is currently working to modify processes and information flow to increase the distribution and response rate for 2024 onwards.   Additionally, the Service is currently developing an Employee Engagement Survey to identify trends earlier and address potential issues in advance of employee departures.ConclusionThis report provides the Board withan annual People and Culture update, including: information on 2023civilian and uniform hiring and promotions; a 2023 secondments update; a summary of applications received for secondary activities in 2023; a summary of thetotalcumulativelegalcostsforlabourrelationscounsel,legalindemnificationclaims,and claims relating toinquestsfor the periodJanuary1to December31,2023.Itincludesthe following appendices;\f19∑new Civilian Job Descriptions;∑aggregate demographic information on applicants/hires/promotions where available;∑examples of events attended in 2023 and ongoing in 2024 meant to drive diversity in hiring and recruitment for both civilian and uniform roles; and ∑a list of funded and unfunded secondment positions filled by Service members during 2023.Also included is an analysis of trends in attraction and hiring from diverse communities, as well as a synopsis of ongoing efforts, challenges and next steps.

The Serviceinitiallyidentified a total estimated savings of $100 Million (M) over 3 years from implementing The Way Forward recommendations. The majority of cost savings were to be realized by actions taken to achieve a 0% budget increase in 2017 and 2018, and by a 3-year hiring moratorium from 2016 to 2018.Additionally, the Service identified approximately $10.6M of required investment costs, with funding expended from the Service’s operating and capital budgets, the Board’s special fund and Policing Effectiveness and Modernization (PEM) grants.The financial resources required to implement some of the specific action items documented in the Appendix to this report have been previously reported to the Board via project updates on The Way Forward implementation, and multi-year updates on the Capital budget program (2017-2023).As reported to the Board in December 2023 in the Service’s Budget Requests Presentation [Min. No. P2023-1219-2.0 refers], cost containment efforts over the past 10 years have led to approximately $270M -$400M cost avoidance, due in large part to the implementation of The Way Forward recommendations. The Service’s10-year history of fiscal responsibility, cost containment,\f2Summary:This report providesan updateonthe Toronto Police Service’s (Service) compliance with implementing Recommendation 79of the 81 Recommendations on Police Reform.Discussion:BackgroundIn August 2020, the Board received a report entitled “Police Reform in Toronto: Systemic Racism, Alternative Community Safety and Crisis Response Models and Building New Confidence in Public Safety” [Min. No. P129/2020 refers], and approved 81 Recommendations, directed to the Service and the Board,intended to direct reform mandates.Recommendation 79in Appendix A of that report reads as follows:Direct the Chief of Police to report by November 2020 on the status ofrecommendations made in Action Plan: The Way Forward, including whathas beenimplemented, what remains to be implemented, and whatadditional recommendations for modernization can lead to more effectiveand efficient police service delivery. This ‘refresh’ of Action Plan: The WayForward should occur on the basis of stakeholder and communityconsultation that recognizes community safety is a shared societalresponsibility. (Board #2; ARAP #14; MHAAP #29)transformation, and operational successes have unfortunately at the cost ofsome core service delivery, increased operational risk and organizational wellbeing.In part,impacted by the aforementioned 3-year hiring freezebetween 2010 to 2022,the Service has seen an 11% decrease in the number of police officers. During this same time period, the population of the City of Toronto increased by 13.1% (460K), which has negatively impacted the ratio of population served per uniform officer. Increasing response times, reduced unit availability to be dispatched and reduced frontline supervision are current policing challenges that can be mapped to The Way Forward’s cost containment recommendations.The Service is currently focused on improving core service delivery through increasing front-line resources to focus on emergency response times and improving oversight and accountability through supervision. This will be accomplished while remaining committed to ongoing reform and modernization initiatives that aim to improve community trust in and within the Service, as well as building partnerships with other organizations with the goal of supporting safer communities.\f3Thefinal Transformational Task Force report,titled “Action Plan: The Way Forward”, was approved by the Board at its February 2017 meeting [Min. No. P19/17 refers]. The reportwas intended to fulfil the TTF’s mandate to develop a modernized policing model that is innovative, sustainable, and affordable. The model was to place communities at its core, be intelligence-led and optimize the best use of resources and technology, while embracing partnerships as a means of enhancing capability and capacity. The report included33 recommendations to change how the Service organizes and delivers policing services. Following the Board’s approval, the Service set about actioning these reform recommendations, and provided quarterly progress updates through 2019.Following the approval of the 81 Recommendations in August 2020, the Service tasked the Strategy Management unit with providing the requested status update on The Way Forward report. At the November 24, 2020 Board meeting, the Board received a report titled “Police Reform in Toronto: Toronto Police Service Initial Response” [Min. No. P182/2020 refers].At that time, the Service advised that 25 of these recommendations could be considered implemented, with 1 not implemented and 7 in progress.Current StateThe Strategy Management -Strategic Projects Unit has continued to trackimplementation ofthe remainingitems marked “In Progress” in the November 2020 updatereportfor Recommendation 79. Each of the 33 Action items listed in the original Action Plan: The Way Forward can now be considered as implemented. Implementation status is broken down as follows:Recommendation StatusNumberImplemented19Implemented and Ongoing13Implemented in Alternative Format1Total33A full description of theimplementation details for each of the action items in The Way Forward report is appended to this report as Appendix A.Conclusion:The Service looks forward to continuing to work together with ourCity partners and other external stakeholders to achieve positive change through implementing all of the 81 Recommendations for Police Reform.Strategy Management –Strategic Projects will provide a full update of implementation efforts at an upcoming Board meeting, and implementation efforts can continue to be tracked via the Police Reform Implementation Dashboard.A/Staff Superintendent Jacqueline Baus will be in attendance to answer any questions that the Board may have regarding this report.\f4Respectfully submitted,Myron Demkiw, M.O.M.Chief of PoliceAttachments:Appendix A –Toronto Police Service Update Re: Recommendation #79 The Way Forward\fAppendix A -Police Reform Recommendation #79 Summary (The Way Forward)Response LegendImplementedImplemented & Ongoing–meaning this recommendation has been operationalized, but work is ongoing and the Service will continue to be guided by the principles within the recommendation.Implemented in Alternative Format–meaning this recommendation has been implementedin a manner that differs from the original recommendation’s wording, while keeping the spirit of the recommendation’s intention.The Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service Update1 –Connected OfficersInvestment in transitioning from Mobile Workstations in vehicles to smart devices carried by all officers. This will include a full application suite and e-Notebook, as well as updating existing applications to a mobile environment and allowing officers to be connected at all times to the most current operational information.Status = Implemented and OngoingThese devices represent a platform that allows members to send and receive corporate information securely allowing for efficient decision making.The project commenced In 2017 with 700 members equipped with mobile devices in 2018. All officers are now equipped with a Connected Officer device. As this is an ongoing operational project, it is considered implemented.2 –Improved Capabilities Related to Data, Information and Analysis, Including Big DataToronto Police Service support the new service delivery model with a strengthened capacity to collect, measure, and evaluate data from a wide range of internal and external sources, including an improvedStatus = Implemented and OngoingThe Analytics and Innovation unit has worked along with other partner units to implement the following initiatives:• Enterprise Business Intelligence Project • Enterprise GIS Project Since 2020, the following initiatives have also been implemented:• Global Search Project • Pushpin Project \fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service Updatecapacity to model demand and workload as well as analytics of large complex data sets (“big data”). With this ability, the Service will be better able to deliver evidence-based policing services where they are needed most, in a way that is proportional, appropriate, and more sustainable.• Analytics Centre of Excellence (ANCOE) Project The Service continues to improve our capabilities through I&IT Command Initiatives, including the Information Management Framework and the Race and Identity Based Data Collection program.3 –Disbanding TAVISTAVIS will be disbanded and existing members will be redeployed to other Service Priorities.Status = ImplementedTAVIS was disbanded in the first half of 2017 and members were redeployed.4 –Risk Assessment for Priority ResponseToronto Police Service develop a riskassessment tool to identify non-emergencies that can be addressed through alternative approaches, including redirection to the mandated city department or other agency.Status= Implementedand OngoingThe TPS was tasked with developing a risk assessment tool to identify non-emergencies that can be addressed through alternative approaches. This principle has been well established to ensure Priority Response units focus on calls that require a police presence and provide effective alternatives when that presence is not required. Significant work has been done in this area, and work continues under the implementation of recommendations made by the City of Toronto Auditor General (AG) related to improving police response to calls for service.5 –Alternative Reporting and Follow-up for Non-EmergenciesThe use of alternative ways for people to report non-emergency situations, i.e. where an immediate officer response is not necessary for personal safety, or tomeet an immediate investigative need, including:• Enhanced, easy to use, and convenient on-line, digital, and by phone reporting tools for low-risk incidents with civilian reporting andintake personnel available by appointment at police stations.• The use of civilian members to more efficiently follow up on less  Status = Implemented and OngoingSince 2017, the Service has innovated in a number of areas related to the reporting of non-emergency situations, including:∑In early 2017 the Strategy Management Unit (STM) was tasked with facilitating the implementation of Community Investigative Support Units (CISU) in each division based on recommendations made in The Way Forward report. This concept had originally been developed in 43 Division and had been shown to provide accommodated members with meaningful duties while providing PRU officers and divisional investigators with time to spend on more urgent duties. Currently CISU’s are operational in all divisions across the Service.∑PRIME unit viainternet (CopLogic)\fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service Updateserious/nonemergency neighbourhood safety incidentsoTPS.ca has reporting options for low risk incidents where public submits reports and receives email in return with report number and information for personal use∑PRIME unit via telephoneoPublic calls into TPS Communications Centre for reporting purposes, when report is identified as low risk can be referred to a telephone report option whereby PRIME calls member of public back to administer report and is provided report number for personal use∑In response to a number of other Police Reform recommendations, including #1 of the 81 Recommendations, initiatives with City partners have been enacted including:oTCCS“Toronto Community Crisis Service”[Gerstein Crisis Centre, TAIBU Community Health Centre, Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA), 2Spirited People of the 1stNations]oCCD “Co-Located Crisis Diversion” (Counsellor embedded at Communications Services Centre for call diversion of non emergent person in crisis calls) oNon-Emergency Calls/Response Steering Committee (NECR SC), which includes membership from TPS leadersas well as members of the City’s Customer Experience, Municipal Licencing & Standards, Social Development, Finance & Administration, and Strategic Public & Employee Communications Divisions. This work will continue as a part of implementing the AG’s recommendations related to Calls for Service. 6 –Improved Public Safety ResponseA specialized Public Safety Response Team be formed with a comprehensive mandate that includes extreme event response, public order, search management, and critical infrastructure protection.Status = ImplementedThis recommendation was completed in May 2017 with the creation of the PSRT (Public SafetyResponse Team). The PSRT is a support to front line policing and community engagement initiatives. It has the ability to provide extreme event response, public order management, search management, and critical infrastructure protection.7 –More Efficient SchedulingWe are recommending that the shift schedule known as the Compressed Work Week be reviewed. The current approach Status = Implemented and OngoingThe task of creating a new schedule began in late 2016. The goal was to provide a more effective schedule for members as well as the organization. In January 2019, a schedule pilot \fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service Updaterequires a consistent deployment, regardless of the time of day or demand patterns, which we believe may limit the Service’s ability to deploy resources more flexibly. Changes in this area will require anegotiated change to the collective agreement with the Toronto Police Association.project was launched in 41 Division to test a 5 on 4 off / 4 on 5 off schedule. This new schedule was selected from a number of options presented to the members. As a result of the positiveresponse in 41 Division, 23 Division showed an interest in the new schedule and members subsequently voted to join in the pilot as well.The Joint Shift Schedule committee evaluated the pilot and in late 2019, the pilot was offered service-wide to all Divisions. Members were provided a comprehensive package that was developed based on division-specific data with several options. After the voting phase, 10 Divisions voted to join the pilot to test the 5/4 schedule and the 7/7 schedule. This service-wide pilot began in January 2020. With the Covid-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, the evaluation of the pilot was greatly impacted. As a result, Divisions currently working a shift schedule pilot were given an opportunity to extend their respective pilots.TheService and TPA agreed to extend the original alternative shift schedule pilot that commenced in January 2020 into 2024.As of January 2024, 16 divisional primary response units (PRU, ETF, TSV and Mounted have voted to work on, and have been working the piloted shift schedules).Currently there are no divisional PRU working the CWW schedule.8 Divisional CIB’s have voted to align with their PRU on piloted schedules and 8 have remained on the CWW.The TPS and the TPA have continued working collaborativelyto monitor and evaluate theschedules throughout the pilot. Once the current Collective Bargaining process is complete, the Service will look to implement a permanent scheduling model/solution.8 –More Effective Deployment in VehiclesUsing risk and demand analysis, webelieve there may be an opportunity toidentify situations whereunaccompanied officers or responsealternatives are more appropriate andwill allow for more effectivedeployment while continuing to ensureofficer safety. Changes withintheStatus = Implemented in Alternative Format (and Ongoing)Through risk and demand analysis, TPS believes there may be an opportunity to identify situations where unaccompanied officers or response alternatives would be a more appropriate response than sending a two-person car. Changes to two person vehicle responses (between 19:00 to 0:300) will require a negotiated change to the collective agreement with the Toronto Police Association. \fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service Updateperiod from 1900 to 0300 will require anegotiated change to the collectiveagreement with the Toronto PoliceAssociation.This recommendation is ongoing as it is constantly being reassessed as it applies to front line response. The Service will continue to work with the TPA to identify opportunities to foster more effective deployment in vehicles.9 –A Risk-Based Response to Special EventsThe Service support special events through a fair and equitable threat and risk assessment. This will focus police resources on events where their presence is necessary for publicsafety. For designated situations, event organizers will be responsible for their own security measures. We are recommending a more integrated structure for special events. Divisions currently support local events within their boundaries, while the PublicSafety-Special Events Unit handles large scale major events. This leads to challenges in consistency of approach, risk assessment, and staffing, which will be addressed in the new design.Status = Implemented and OngoingThe Service has made significantimprovements to the way special events are handled since 2020:∑A process & related application for managing Corporate Events staffing, where uniform members up to the rank of S/Sgt or D/Sgt can self-select a required minimum of shifts to work during an identified Corporate Event∑Better alignment with Paid Duty and other Service areas like Public Order ∑Under the new Service Based Budgeting model, Events and Protests have been highlighted as 1 of 6 Service areasHowever, significant new challenges to policing events since 2017 have impacted our service delivery in this area:∑As noted in November 2023 Budget Subcommittee meeting [Min. No. P…refers], in 2023 the Service managed 3,600 special events, including sporting events and events related to the Middle East conflict∑There are now 8 City agencies that can issue event permits∑Significantcost increases due to increased attendance, longer celebrations, a larger footprint/multiple locations for some festivals have incurred ($ 2023 over $ 2019):oVictoria Day costs up 516%oPride costs up 223%oCanada Day costs up 140%oCaribbean Carnival costs up 78%oCNE costs up 70%Current areas of focus in this area are the Project Resolute actions and planning for the upcoming FIFA World Cup matches in 202610 –A More Efficient Retail ResponseRecommendation from Interim Report:Status = Implemented\fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service UpdateToronto Police Services Board seekthe Government of Ontario’s approvalto appoint and train selected securityguards at major shopping malls asSpecial Constables. These individualswill be authorized to process andrelease arrested individuals indesignated non-emergency situations.We estimate that through this change,it will be possible to saveapproximately 5,500 hours of policingservices per year, while reducing costsfor the private sector.A more efficient retail response was intended to improve and streamline the approach to dealing with shoplifters but due to lack of buy-in from stakeholders in the retail security sector the recommendation as written was discontinued. However, the concept was introduced in 2019, on a smaller scale, in the downtown core as a Shop Theft Release Program pilot in 51 and 52 Division.This pilot has led to the expansion of the program in other divisions across the city. The program has resulted in a reduction in the number of shop theft calls that are attended by front line officers when persons are detained by stakeholders and has reduced the amount of time parties are detained by stakeholders for relatively minor offences before being released. The pilot program has also improved the relationships that TPS has with the retail sector. The pilot programalso respects many of the fundamentals outlined in Bill C-75.As of April 1, 2023, the pilot has been operating successfully in 22, 23, 32, 33, 41, 43, 51, 52, and 55Divisions. 11 –Disband the Transit Patrol UnitDisbanding the Transit Patrol Unit. The Unit was originally established to supplement the day-to-day role of Divisions to respond to calls for service related to Toronto TransitCommission vehicles, subways and properties. However, this role is no longer required since the Toronto Transit Commission now has a highly capable Special Constable Program in place, and local Divisions will continue to respond to calls as required. Transit Patrol Unit members will be redeployed to other priorities.Status = ImplementedThe Transit Patrol Unit was disbanded in first half of 2017,sending 67 officers back to divisional Primary Response Units. The TTC special constable program was revised and provided the backfill for the TPS officers that no longer patrolled TTC properties. TTC Special Constables have since taken over the duties that transit patrol officers previously performed.12 –Alternative Delivery of the Lifeguard ProgramToronto Police Service LifeguardProgram and its $1.1 million budgetbecome the responsibility of theappropriate department Status = ImplementedThe Way Forward report recommended that TPS divest itself of the responsibility of administering the Lifeguard Program. In 2017 the TPS began working with the city to explore, plan and build the capacity at the city to deliver the program in a new model administered by \fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service Updateof the City ofToronto. This program provideslifeguard services on Toronto beacheswhile the City of Toronto provideslifeguard services for the rest of theCity. Civilian staff currently supportingthis program will be redeployed toother priorities.the city. The Service has been administering the program since 1982, when the Service amalgamated with theHarbor Police. The cost of $1.2 million is funded by the City to the TPS and lifeguards are trained, equipped and supervised by the Service.Throughout 2018 and into the 2019 season the TPS worked with the City of Toronto Park, Forestry and Recreation to support the transition of the program. The program finished its full transition to the City of Toronto following the 2019 season (After Labour Day). Any future support provided by the TPS will be outlined in a memorandum of understanding that is still being finalized.13 –Alternate Delivery of the School Crossing Guard ProgramThe School Crossing Guard Program,with its $6.8 million budget, becomethe responsibility of the City ofToronto, or an alternative. Currently,the Toronto Police Service administersthe program and sends officers to fill inwhen crossing guards areunexpectedly absent. Thisrecommendation will allow membersthat support the program to beredeployed to other priorities.Status = ImplementedThe Way Forward report recommended that the TPS begin transferring the function of School CrossingGuards from the TPS to the City. This is consistent with the TTF mandate to return to core policing. Toensure police officers were not responsible for covering vacant crossings, Strategy Managementworked with the City to come up with a plan for the 2018-2019 school year. Backfills were hired by theCity and when school started in September they covered vacant crossings. From September toDecember the City was responsible for backfilling 7035 school crossings. Full transfer of the programoccurred on August 1st, 2019. The City of Toronto now manages the program through TransportationServices.14 –Using Traffic Technology Enforcement to Improve Community SafetyThe City of Toronto implement trafficenforcement cameras that are ownedand operated by the City of Toronto, inschool zones and areas identified ashaving higher collision rates, as a wayof modifying driver behaviour andreducing risks. This recommendationmeans that our City will use allof thetools it can to provide the right mix ofprevention, enforcement, andresponse.Status = ImplementedThe Way Forward report recommended implementation of traffic enforcement cameras in school zonesand areas identified as having higher collision rates. The City of Toronto had already established priorto this recommendation some red light cameras that effectively influenced safer driving behaviour ofmotorists.During the past three years Red light cameras in the city have more than doubled and have beenstrategically placed with shared data from TPS to the city which has resulted in continued improvementto road safety. In addition, speed enforcement cameras have been placed in numerous school zonesacross the city.In the future, as technology improves and becomes capable of enforcing additional violations,recommendations will be made to the Vision Zero team at the City of Toronto.15 –Overhauling Paid DutyStatus = Implemented and Ongoing\fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service UpdateAn overhaul of the Paid Duty process.The current process is not wellunderstood and often puts thereputation of the Toronto PoliceService at risk. In our final report wewill include recommendations for a riskassessment model to ensure that off dutypolice officers are only utilized ina paid duty capacity where the skills,authorities,and training of a policeofficer are necessary. We will also beclear about those situations whereprivate security is the appropriatealternative.TPS and the involved stakeholders believe a holistic approach to both special events and paid duties will lead to an efficient, consistent approach to the way TPS and the City of Toronto manage their resources and identify risks to public safety. Implementation of this recommendation was placed on hold for a time due to COVID-19 Pandemic. Since then, anumber of significant updates to the Paid Duty program have been made, including:∑Holistic alignment of applications/programs related to overtime/callbacks under EMPO ∑Upgraded Paid Duty Management System (PDMS), now available via MyPortal and with enhanced functionalityWork continues in this area under the leadership of EMPO16 –City-Wide Divisional Boundary and Facilities RealignmentToronto Police Service begin a phasedredesign of its Divisional structure andalignment of facilities. The redesignwill follow the principle of lifting allboundaries from the city map, andthen using demand and workloadmodelling to draw new boundaries andfacility locations that take into accountthe boundaries of Toronto’s 140neighbourhoods, and coordinate betterwith the planning of other city andprovincial services.Status = Implemented and OngoingThe original scope of work for this recommendation included the following components:∑Align with City boundaries and consolidate from 17 to 10 districts.∑Facility review to align with modernization needs.∑Assessing/redesigning core business processes to effectively operateas a district; including integrating other initiatives.The recommendation was renamed to the District Policing Program to better describe the impact on people, processes, technology and infrastructure required to support the new model of policing in 2019.In 2021, following a review, Command decided that a centralized district operational model did not meet conceptualexpectations of the initial project plan/scope. The review determined that the oversight required in large police divisions does not align with the proposed district approach. As a result, project work was refocused on enhancing service delivery by updating processes and technology. The following initiatives have since been implemented:∑Introduction of Video Bail Capabilities in 5 police divisions∑Facility upgrades, including wellness rooms\fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service Update∑Upgraded Radio & Telecom capabilities∑Staffing Analysis/modelling of optimal PRU deployment∑Review to optimize and standardize divisional CIB capabilitiesThis work will continue as a part of implementing the AG’s recommendations related to Calls for Service.17 –More Accessible and Transparent Informationand ServicesAs the Divisional map is redesigned,we are recommending an investmentin modern technology to offer thepublic open access to information andtools that communities can use toimprove neighbourhood safety,including:• A public safety data portal toencourage the creation and use ofopen data for public safety in Toronto.• A wider, up-to-date range of meansto speak with neighbourhood officers –in person and by phone, but alsothrough video calling, social media,and the Toronto Police Services app.• Enhancing the Toronto PoliceService app• Enhancing real-time data andinformation about what’s happening inneighbourhoods• Offering technology that bringscommunities together to crowdsourceand solve safety problems• Offering technology for communities toanonymously crowdsource and reportconcerns about officersStatus = Implemented and OngoingThe Way Forward report recommended an investment in modern technology to offer the public openaccess to information and tools that communities can use to improve neighbourhood safety.In 2017 work began on the Public Safety Data Portal to encourage the use of open data for publicsafety in Toronto. The portal is intended to improve the understanding of policing, improvetransparency, and enhance confidence. The portal is enhancing the real-time data and informationabout what’s happening in neighbourhoods, including crime trends, traffic information and more generalpolicing metrics, while respecting privacy requirements. The portal has functionality to visualize policedata through charts, graphs and maps as well as to download data in standard formats.The portal also has a section to view released Freedom of Information Requests (FOIs).The Analyticsand Innovation unit hosts ongoing internal and external information sessions. The open data portalendeavors to continually update new datasets and create new partnerships to provide relevantstatistics for the public.Members can view the portal here: http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/TPS is also continuing to develop applicable data governance and information management practicesfor these initiatives. Moving forward, the Analytics and Innovation Unit will continue to look at newinnovative ways to use data to achieve the modernization goals of the Service and will continue to independently report their progress to the Board, on their respective projects.18 –Moratorium on Hiring and PromotionsA carefully managed moratorium onhiring and promotionsbetween ranks forofficers Status = Implemented\fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service Updateand civilians over the next threeyears while the Service designs anddeploys the new service delivery model.This moratorium will allow the Service toensure that it has the right type andnumber of members for the new servicedelivery model, and the leanest possiblemanagement structure. There will besome circumstances where hiring orfilling vacant positions may benecessary –for example, to makeinvestments in modernization, achieveother strategic priorities, comply withlegislative requirements, or provideadequate supervision. In thesesituations, the Service will implement arigorous and transparent assessmentprocess before approval is given, andwill continue to report on the numberand types of situations where it hasbeen necessary to do so.In 2016 the Service embarked on a moratorium on hiring and promotions between ranks for officers andcivilians. In May 2018 the hiring moratorium officially ended and TPS began hiring Civilians and swornmembers again.19 –Assessing Information Technology RequirementsToronto Police Service retain anexternal expert advisor to reviewpotential efficiencies, alternativeservice delivery models, and futuretrends for information technology inpolicing. Theadvice will includeimmediate efficiencies that may bepossible through benchmarking, aswell as an Information Technology Unitorganizational assessment andidentification of opportunities foralternative service deliverymechanisms.Status = Implementedand OngoingThe Way Forward Report recommended that the TPS retain an expert advisor to review potentialefficiencies, alternative service delivery models and future trends for information technology in policing.The advice was to include an assessment and benchmark of the Information Technology Unit (ITS)capacity, organizational reporting structure and provide recommendations and a multi year roadmap.The assessment was completed by an unbiased, well known technology research company and thefinal report was presented to the Chief and TPS Command in January 2019.The report warned that ITS was significantly under staffed based on peer groups that have theequivalent mandate and workload. Between the assessment, benchmark and capacity report and theexisting three year ITS strategic plan, ITS has worked towards a significant transformation to align withtheir TPS business partners. The recommendation is considered closed, however, work will continue toexecute the 3 year plan identified in the two \fThe Way Forward RecommendationToronto Police Service Updatedocuments.In April of 2020 a new Chief Information Officer position was created in the organizational chart. ColinStairs was hired and is in the process of operationalizing the efficiencies contained in The WayForward.It is recommended that this issue be closed. The Service’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) Colin Stairs hasreviewed all documentation relating to the assessment and has implemented a comprehensive BenefitsFramework to address the recommendations in the Way Forward Report. The CIO has a program strategy in place to move forward with the significant transformation to better align with our TPS business partners. 20 –Alternative or Shared Delivery of Court ServicesToronto Police Service fully assesswhether alternatives exist that canreduce costs while ensuring that theToronto Police Service fulfills its courtsecurity obligations under the PoliceServices Act.Status = ImplementedThe Way Forward report recommended a full assessment on whether there are better alternatives tothe current Parking Enforcement Unit and Court Services unit that would lower operating costs. Indetermining the feasibility of this recommendation a cost benefit analysis was conducted. This analysiswas to aid in determining if there are different service delivery models that could prove more efficientand/or effective than the current status quo and should therefore be explored further. The City ofToronto took the lead in securing Ernst and Young (EY) to conduct the analysis. The final report waspresented to the City by EY in July 2018. In October 2018, the report remained confidential with theBoard.The TPS had prepared a response to the EY report and found that, through an investment in currentand future initiatives and along with a review of processes and personnel, the Service continuouslyworks towards finding budgetary and operational efficiencies.21 –Alternate or Shared Delivery of Parking EnforcementThe Service fully assess whether thereare better alternatives to the currentParking Enforcement Unit that willlower operating costs –as has alsobeen recommended by previousreviews.

The New Courthouse provides services for the four (4) legacy courthouses (1000 Finch West, College Park, Scarborough and Old City Hall) which were relocated into the New Courthouse in 2023. The closure of the four (4) courthouses will provide cost savings to the T.P.S. for the lifecycle of the four (4) legacy T.P.S. owned/operated In-building Radio Bi-Directional Amplifier (BDA)systems. This cost saving is approximately $150,000.00 for each building/courthouse for the hardware, plus additional labour costs for maintenance and support.  \f2Summary:In 2016, the Ministry of the Attorney General and Infrastructure Ontario began substantive planning for a new Toronto courthouse and in 2019, EllisDonCorporation began construction. The new building would amalgamate five (5) Ontario Courts of Justice in Toronto into one 17-floor building in the downtown core and additionally, one (1) of the courthouses in the north-west end of the City would become a dedicated ‘bail centre’. In spring 2022, the Ministry of the Attorney General announced the New Courthouse would be operational as of March 2023. The original five (5) Ontario Courts of Justice courthouses would be phased out between March and June, 2023. In accordance with the Police Services Act (P.S.A.), now the Community Safety and Policing Act (C.S.P.A.), the T.P.S. must provide voice communication (e.g. radio communication) to frontline officers and field operations for officer safety requirement. In order for the T.P.S. to provide policing services within the New Courthouse facility, including communication between T.P.S. officers, a new radio system needed to be installed in the New Courthouse facility.  At the beginning of the project for the New Courthouse, it was determined that proper radio coverage was required in order for T.P.S. Court Services to support the Ministry of the Attorney General and court proceedings. In early conversations with the T.P.S. radio technical team, it was agreed that in the event of an emergency within the courthouse, the radios for the T.P.S., Toronto Fire Services and Toronto Paramedic Services should all work within the New Courthouse. For this requirement to be met, the T.P.S. team worked closely with Infrastructure Ontario in the design, installation and testing of the radio system at the New The system lifecycle for a typical In-building Radio System (Radio Coverage Enhancement a.k.a. Bi-Directional Amplifier -BDA system) is ten (10) years which means the T.P.S. will need to lifecycle this radio system at approximately 2033 (under City / T.P.S. capital or lifecycle budget). Upon expiry of all warranties associated with this new radio system within the next ten (10) years, the T.P.S. will be responsible for spare parts (approximately 10% of the system components) of system repairs, rehabilitation, maintenance, support and/or replacement (hardware plus labour cost). The radio system for the New Courthouse is planned to be included in the next lifecycle of the City of Toronto’s Toronto Radio Infrastructure Program (T.R.I.P). The T.P.S. maintains and supports the T.R.I.P as it provides shared radio services for the T.P.S., Toronto Fire Services and Toronto Paramedic Services.  The lifecycle of the T.R.I.P is 15 years and the next lifecycle will start in 2029 (under the City/T.P.S. capital project).     As of March 26, 2023 any maintenance or additions to the system required to the New Courthouse radio system, as determined through testing conducted by the T.P.S., were the sole cost to the T.P.S. and managed by the T.P.S.’s Infrastructure Services Unit. Upon expiry of all warranties associated with the New Courthouse radio system, the T.P.S. will be responsible for repairs or rehabilitation and/or replacement of the radio system.\f3Courthouse to ensure that radio coverage within the building for all T.P.S., Toronto Fire Services and Toronto Paramedic Service radios would function in accordance with business requirements. The existing T.R.I.P was designed and implemented for the street level radio and in-building coverage behind the first wall. The existing/legacy seven (7) courthouses (still operating and/or recently closed) each have an In-Building Radio System (Radio Coverage Enhancement -BDA). The New Courthouse must maintain the same functionality for voice communication for officer safety requirements mandated by the P.S.A. and now the C.S.P.A.Discussion:BackgroundUnder the Agreement, H.M.K. agreed it would cause its construction company, EllisDon Corporation (EllisDon), to construct the T.P.S. radio system in accordance with specifications and requirements drafted with the assistance of the T.P.S.  H.M.K. oversaw the construction of the radio system, with the Agreement granting the T.P.S. with certain inspection and commissioning rights during that process. H.M.K. provided the T.P.S. with access to the radio system on March 26, 2023.  After handover, H.M.K. remained the owner of the radio systemand retained responsibility for the maintenance, rehabilitation or repairs to the radio system, while the T.P.S. was able to use and test the radio system.Following handover and until January 31, 2025, if the T.P.S. identifies any defect, deficiency or item of outstanding work in relation to the radio system, the T.P.S. will notify H.M.K. and H.M.K. will communicate the same to EllisDon who will use reasonable commercial efforts to correct the issue.H.M.K. also provided the T.P.S. with the various manufacturers’ or product warranties which apply to the radio system, and the T.P.S. will notify H.M.K. with respect to a warranty claim that may arise. H.M.K. will communicate any warranty claims to EllisDon and EllisDon will use reasonable commercial efforts to correct the relevant issue.The T.P.S. does not have a direct contract with EllisDon or any warranty provider.The radio system has been fully operational and in use by T.P.S. officers at the New Courthouse facility since March 2023 and it is now at the final stage of operational transfer to the T.P.S. The T.P.S. will continue to work with H.M.K. to identify any defect, deficiency or mechanical issue relating to the radio system in order for H.M.K. to rectify any operational issues while H.M.K. continues to own the radio system and while the manufacturers’ or product warranties are still valid.   The Agreement states that H.M.K. will transfer all of its rights, title and interest in and to the equipment, comprising the New Courthouse radio system, to the T.P.S. on January 31, 2025.  The T.P.S. will not pay H.M.K. for this transfer.  As owner of the new radio system at the New Courthouse effective January 31, 2025, the T.P.S. will be responsible for all aspects of the radio system upon this transfer occurring.The Agreement speaks to various liability provisions between the parties.  \f4Upon H.M.K. handing the radio system over to the T.P.S. on March 26, 2023 the T.P.S. assumed liability for the radio system. Under the Agreement, H.M.K.’s liability is limited to any direct losses incurred by the T.P.S. as a result of a breach by H.M.K. of the Agreement, or as a result of the negligence or wilful misconduct of H.M.K. that occurred in respect of the performance of H.M.K.’s obligations under the Agreement.  H.M.K.’s liability is further capped at the amount H.M.K. can recover from EllisDon as a result of the matter. The Agreement between the TPSB and H.M.K. has been reviewed as to form by the City of Toronto Solicitor.  The Agreement has also been reviewed and approved by T.P.S. Counsel to ensure that the legal and operational requirements of the T.P.S. are adequately protected. The Agreement has necessitated extensive input, consultation, and review by representatives from City Legal, TPS Finance, Court Services, Infrastructure Services and Legal Services, to ensure that all operational and financial obligations have been addressed and incorporated into the Agreement.Conclusion:It is recommended that the Board authorize the Chair to execute the Agreement between the Board and the H.M.K. for the radio system at the New Courthouse. This Agreement is important for both parties to define and clarify the roles and responsibilities of the T.P.S. and H.M.K. in the development and operational aspects of the new radio system at the New Courthouse, including the handover and transfer date, of when the T.P.S. acquires ownership of the new radio system at the New Courthouse.Deputy Chief Robert Johnson will be in attendance to answer any questions that the Board may have regarding this report.Respectfully submitted,Myron Demkiw, M.O.M.Chief of Police\fToronto Police Service Board40 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2J3|Phone: 416-808-8080   Fax: 416-808-8082 |www.tpsb.caPUBLIC REPORTMay 29, 2024To:Chair and MembersToronto Police Service BoardFrom:Myron DemkiwChief of PoliceSubject:TheDowntown Community Outreach Response and Engagement Team (CORE) Pilot Project ImplementationPurpose:☒Information Purposes Only☐Seeking DecisionRecommendations:This report recommends thatthe Toronto Police Service Board (Board)receive this report Financial Implications:There are no financial implications relating to the recommendations contained within this report. The 2024 operating budget includes salary and overhead funding to increase the number of deployed police officers by 307 from December 2023 to December 2024.

To mitigate the effects of congestion, the City launched a Congestion Management Plan in 2016. This plan included a set of initiatives tackling congestion from different angles. One of these initiatives was the implementation of a Traffic Assistance Personnel Pilot Program. The Traffic Assistance Personnel (TAP) Pilot Program was successfully piloted in 2016 by Toronto Police Service. Through this pilot, Toronto Police Paid Duty Officers were deployed at different intersections in downtown Toronto to manage the flow of pedestrians and vehicles. This pilot successfully reduced the number of intersection blockages caused by vehicles and pedestrians by 90% and 70%, respectively. The Traffic Agent Program was created based on the positive impacts observed in the TAP pilot. The City of Toronto Traffic Agent Program was formalized on February 6, 2020, when the City of Toronto and the Toronto Police Service signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The MOU gives the city the ability of hiring and training staff to become special constables. Special constables have authority under the Highway Traffic Act to undertake traffic management functions.  Additionally, the MOU dictates and regulates a set of actions and procedures that the City of Toronto must follow when training, appointing, tracking, and administering traffic agents. It also delineates the administrative responsibilities of the city while running the program, one of which is to provide the Toronto Police Services Board with an Annual Report.  The Traffic Agent Program has been successfully operating for over three years. Traffic Agents have been deployed at many different intersections and have had a huge impact on traffic congestion at critical intersections, construction areas, and the King Street Transit Priority Corridor. The Traffic Agent program continues to work in partnership with Toronto Police Service and continues to grow the partnership. \f4 | P a g e       The Traffic Agent Program falls under the City of Toronto Transportation Services under the direction of the Traffic Management section and Active Traffic Management unit. In 2023, the Traffic Agent Program had a successful year in recruiting and hired over 30 traffic agents, two supervisors and a program manager.     At the start of 2023, the program consisted of 3 Special Constables due to the job market conditions in 2022, when six Traffic Agents took other jobs within the City of Toronto. In 2023, staffing levels increased exponentially with 3 classes being hired. Two of the classes were fulling trained and deployed in 2023 which brought staffing levels to 22 Special Constables Full Time and 4 Special Constables Part Time. In addition, Class 4 is in their final stages of training and is expected to be in the field as of 2024 Q1. Class 4 consists of 12 Full Time Special Constables, which will make the program have a total of 38 Special Constables.   Number of Terminations (January  1, 2023 – December 31, 2023) Number of Suspensions (January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023) Number of Resignations (January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023) Number of Retirements (January 1, 2023 – Dec 31, 2023) 2 0 2 0 Organizational Chart Traffic Agent Program Supervisor Traffic Agent Program Supervisor Traffic Agent Program Supervisor Traffic Agent Program Supervisor Traffic Agent Program Program Manager Traffic Agent Program Senior Project Manager Active Traffic Management Manager Traffic Management Section Director Transportation Services General Manager  Traffic Agents  Traffic Agents  Traffic Agents  Traffic Agents Staffing Levels \f5 | P a g e    Supervision   In 2023, The Traffic Agent Program grew from two supervisors to four supervisors, who provided support through regular site visits and coaching to ensure a high standard of public service and safety for the Traffic Agents as well as the public. Supervisors regularly attended various intersections throughout the city, providing supervision, assessing conditions and the traffic management techniques of CTAs (City Traffic Agents). The Supervisors also spent a lot of time training the three classes that were hired in 2024 and ensuring the first two classes were ready to hit the road in 2023.  In addition, one Program Manager was hired to oversee the 4 supervisors and traffic agents. The Program Manager is also assisting the Senior Program Manager in building the program.   Uniform & Equipment   The City Traffic Agents are full-time employees who are expected to work during the entire year and therefore, under different weather conditions. The City of Toronto foresees that uniform and equipment needs will evolve over time as a consequence of the lessons learned and new case applications.   At the beginning of the program, Traffic Agents were issued a basic uniform and equipment. Additional items were added to address different health and safety requirements and to account for different weather and lighting conditions experienced during the different seasons and working hours.   In 2022, the City of Toronto completed a business case regarding all the uniforms and equipment needed by Traffic Agents. The City of Toronto submitted it to Toronto Police Service and it was subsequently approved by the Toronto Police Services Board.   Traffic Agents were issued the following:  • Uniform  • One wallet badge and City Identification Card • One approved Memo Book • One Whistle  • Mobile Phone • Flashlight and wand, with appropriate carrying case • Parking Violation Notice Book • First Aid Kit   At the end of 2023, the program submitted a new business case to conduct a pilot to investigate the feasibility of adding a protective vest to increase the safety of Traffic Agents.  \f6 | P a g e    Training   All Traffic Agents were provided the mandatory training outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding. All course outlines, course curricula, lesson plans, and course instructors’ resumes were approved by the Toronto Police Service. The mandatory training consists of the following areas:  • Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act • Arrest Authorities • Arrest / Search Incident to Arrest • By-law Enforcement • Case Preparation Provincial Offences • Community Mobilization / Community Policing • Traffic / Crime Scene Management • City Traffic Agent Status – Roles & Responsibilities • Criminal Offences • Diversity Awareness and Human Right Issues • Person in Crisis / Mental Health Act • Ethics and Professionalism • Field Interviewing / Taking Statements • First Aid / CPR (including Naloxone) • Highway Traffic Act and Traffic Direction • Incident Management • Introduction to Law • Memorandum Books / Note-Taking • Occupational Health & Safety • Occurrence / Reporting Writing / Field Information Report • Ontario Traffic Manual Book 7 • Ontario Traffic Manual Book 1 • Provincial Offences Act • Public Safety Foundations • Road to Mental Readiness • Search and Seizure Authorities • Testimony / Criminal / Provincial Justice System / Rules of Evidence • Traffic Management (in class and in field) • Transportation Services • YCJA • Basic Self Defence • Crisis Resolution • Tactical Communications \f7 | P a g e       Traffic Agents had no incidents in 2023 where use of force was required. The Traffic Agents do not have any use of force options and are trained to de-escalate and disengage from situations. Traffic Agents are instructed to call Police in emergency situations.      Throughout 2023 Traffic Agents were required to deal with members of the public who on occasion did not comply with the direction(s) of the Traffic Agent or committed violations under the Highway Traffic Act. Traffic agents used TPS support in the form of the Toronto Police Online Reporting tool (CORE – Driving Complaint) of which Traffic Agents completed 32 reports in 2023 of motorists in violation of the Highway Traffic Act. In addition, the Traffic Agents wrote another 138 reports for other types of incidents such as near misses, medicals, aggression from public, person in crisis etc. Toronto Police also assisted Traffic Agents on King Street on numerous occasions by giving out tickets to drivers that drove against the posted signs, or didn’t follow directions given by Traffic Agents.    All public complaints against Traffic Agents are reviewed by the Unit Complaints Coordinator who has been trained by the Toronto Police Service’s Professional Standards Unit. The Unit Complaints Coordinator reviews the complaint and ensures it has all the necessary information required prior to being submitted to the Toronto Police Service for review and assessment. The Toronto Police Service investigates all serious misconduct while all other minor public complaints and feedback, deemed less serious, are returned, to the city for investigation by the Program Managers and Supervisors. These public complaints and feedback are further utilized to assist in the assessment and development of the program. In 2023, the Traffic Agent program received 0 complaints.   Total Complaints Investigated by Toronto Police Service Investigated by the City Resolved Complaints Number of Outstanding Complaints 0  0 0 0 0 Use of Force Compliance & Enforcement Complaints \f8 | P a g e     Impacts   In 2023, the City Traffic Agent Program started off with just 3 Traffic Agents as mentioned, and the program strongly focused on hiring, training and deploying the new traffic agents to the field.  Once the traffic agents were in the field, they quickly helped mitigate congestion throughout various intersections across the city. Traffic agents continued to help manage traffic daily at Allen Road and Eglinton Avenue West, where there are congestion issues due to the ongoing construction. In addition, Traffic Agents supported many critical intersections in the downtown core during rush hour.   At the beginning of August 2023 Traffic Agents were deployed to a few critical intersections on King Street to help assist TTC and ensure the intersections remained clear for the streetcars to travel. It was quickly realized that there would need to be several traffic agents deployed to numerous intersections as there were still lengthy delays on King Street, due to drivers not following the rules of the King Street Transit Priority Corridor. The streetcar travel times were between 45 – 65 minutes along King Street during rush hour when traffic agents were not present. Traffic agents began to help TTC drastically by ensuring vehicles were turning off King Street and obeying the rules of the posted signs. After traffic agents were deployed to 6 critical intersections on King Street the travel time was reduced by 3 times to an average of 17 to 21 minutes when they were present.  Please see the graph below displaying eastbound travel times on King Street.                   \f9 | P a g e   Traffic Agents also continued to provide signal maintenance support at approximately 1843 different intersections in 2023.  Of the 10,503 active hours by Traffic Agents in 2023, 4918 hours were at critical intersections. Traffic agents started getting deployed to a couple critical intersections on King Street in August 2023, and then to numerous locations on King Street in November 2023. In this short time frame Traffic Agents provided a total of 1,471 active hours on King Street. Traffic agents were able to help TTC significantly on King Street by ensuring the intersection wasn’t blocked and redirecting vehicles off King Street based on the posted signs for the King Street Transit Priority.  Please see the graph below that displays this data and other critical intersections our program focused on in 2023.

It should be noted some intersections were worked at multiple days which is why the value is higher for signal maintenance intersections then total different intersections as mentioned above:    In 2022 the traffic agent program focused on construction areas, such as Allen Road and Eglinton Avenue West, and Roehampton Avenue and Yonge Street. In 2023 these locations were a focus point again, predominantly Allen Road and Eglinton Avenue West in 2023, requiring a total of 2922 active hours between the two locations, whereas in 2022, coverage was a total of 1844 total active hours.

Critical intersections and construction sites were the focus for the 2023, up until November 2023 when the demands changed, and the King Street Transit Priority Corridor became the focus of the program. The King Street Transit Priority Corridor required a total of 10-11 agents every afternoon from November through December 2023. Agents were able to help the TTC reduce their travel times on King Street, by educating drivers to turn off King Street, and ensuring the box didn’t become blocked at numerous intersections along King Street.

Since then, Toronto Police Services provides a total of 13 Constables & Special Constables who support 7 locations in the downtown core which include: Spadina & Lake Shore, Spadina & Bremner, York & Lake Shore, York & Bremner, University & Front, Front & Bay, and Lower Jarvis & Lake Shore. This support has allowed for increased safety and improved traffic flow through these critical intersections. The pilot will continue under evaluation during 2024. Transportation Services thanks Toronto Police Services for their continued support during this pilot.      Conclusion   The City of Toronto was able to grow the Traffic Agent Program staffing levels by a considerable amount in 2023. At the start of the year there were a total of 3 Traffic Agents and by the end of 2023 the team consisted of 26 active Traffic Agents and 12 Agents in training. The Traffic Agent program will allow the City of Toronto to continue to help Toronto Police by being a reliable resource for traffic mitigation during rush hours, at construction sites, during infrastructure maintenance activity and during other events when needed. The Program will continue to increase compliance along King Street by staffing these intersections. Prior to agents arriving, travel times were up to 65 minutes on streetcar along King Street. Since traffic agents have been deployed, they were able to provide a direct impact in reducing travel times along King Street up to 3 times, as the travel times have now been reduced to 17 minutes. Traffic agents will continue to cover King Street into 2024 and ensure an increased efficiency of the transit vehicles through the corridor.  2023 was a successful year and the Program met its short-term hiring objectives. The Traffic Agent Program will continue to grow as required to manage congestion and other traffic issues that arise in the City of Toronto.     \f2023UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO - ST.

In 1904, the Universityestablished the Campus Police Service. Because the University was not originally part of the cityservice plan, it was responsible for its own policing. Constables were appointed by the Province.Later, city police service was provided through mutual aid agreements.The University of Toronto Governing Council and the Toronto Police Services Board entered intoan agreement in 1995. Today, we provide Special Constable services to support the Universitycommunity and the Toronto Police Service by responding to calls for service and incidents onUniversity property in a timely and community-oriented manner. Currently providing service to acommunity of approximately 97,000 students and more than 25,000 faculty and staff. In 2022,the University of Toronto Campus Police changed its name to the University of Toronto CampusSafety Service. The service has three functional groups – St. George (Downtown), Scarboroughand Mississauga Campuses. Each is functionally separate but work under a common policy.There are two separate Special Constable agreements – one with the Peel Regional PoliceServices Board and the other with the Toronto Police Services Board. More than 10,000students live in residence on the St. George campus and the balance use transit and othermeans of transportation to attend as day students.The University of Toronto is the largest and most diverse university in Canada and the UnitedStates (by enrolment). The University has international students from 170 countries and regionswith almost every racial, language, ethnic, national, political and religious group beingrepresented. Approximately 20,000 new students are admitted to the University every year and asimilar number are granted degrees. During the non- academic year, the University is host tostudents from around the world looking for a Canadian experience. The University is a peacefulplace where issues are explored, debated and at times argued. The freedom to speak, believeand learn is fundamental to the institution.Despite, or because of its differences, the University thrives in the world of research and culture.By all of the standards used to assess the safety of a community in Canada, the University ofToronto remains a safe environment. Our campuses are open to the community. They are thesource of much of the academic culture available in the cities of Toronto and Mississauga.It is the role of the Special Constable Service to recognize and anticipate issues and takecorrective action. For this reason, each campus service has responsibilities beyond communitypolicing and law enforcement. We provide safety and security plans, systems and services. Ourmethodology relies heavily on Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)principles for physical security and through partnerships with various university offices for socialand community development, safety planning and coordination of crisis services. The result is alevel of service sought by many academic and community organizations. It serves our communitywell.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY3\fUNIVERSITY OFTORONTOCAMPUS SAFETYUCUMSAPThe University of Toronto Campus Safety Special Constable Service at the St. George Campusoperate 24/7 utilizing groups of uniform personnel led by a Staff Sergeant, assisted by aCorporal and dispatcher to support and guide the Special Constables in their work.The Director, Campus Safety manages a portfolio that includes the Special ConstableService, Operations and the Community Liaison & Support Team led by Assistant Directors.Non-Sworn services include Security Guard Services, Call Centre and Security Systems andAccess.

The training program is developed through consultation with thecommunity, other institutions, and case debriefing of situations.The recent passing of Bill 68, the New Police Services Act-Impacts on Special Constables withspecific topics that are legislated to be included into the training programs of special constablesin the province of Ontario. Those topics include Ethics and Leadership, Racial Profiling, Anti-Oppression-Micro Aggression and Diversity, Crime Scene Management, Community BasedPolicing - (CPTED) and Drug Investigations and Effects. We include this learning in ourOrientation and Refresher training that all our special constables receive. The Service welcomes constructive comment from its clients.

The nature of the Universitycommunity requires its special constables to have a high level of understanding of the cultures,beliefs, and experiences of people from all over the world. Understanding people and developing empathy for their situations is essential to providingcommunity policing services. There are core learning requirements that lead to understandingdiversity in many parts of the training, not just in courses titled as such. The initiatives takenare highlighted in the chart.

Scarborough, we believe that developing a safe and secure environment is a shared responsibility, and along with the strong partnerships we have developed with various departments and our community, community-based safety initiatives play a particularly key role in our continued success.  Special Constables are staff members employed by the University of Toronto who are appointed under the Community Safety and Policing Act and are subject to approval of the Toronto Police Service Board. The Special Constables are governed by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Governing Council and the Toronto Police Services Board and currently hold authorities and responsibilities under various federal, provincial, and municipal statutes, including the Criminal Code, Trespass to Property Act, Mental Health Act and Liquor License and Control Act.   In 2023, UTSC experienced many achievements. In January, a new Staff Sergeant was promoted through a promotional process in late 2022. The summer was busy with events and activities on the campus. The Fall term was marked by the opening of the Harmony Commons residence, a nine-story student residence containing 746 beds and an all-you-care-to-eat dining hall. In November, Campus Safety moved into their new office within Harmony Commons. Management and Administrative staff now operate out of Harmony Commons and the Special Constables, Building Patrollers and Community Crisis Response Coordinator operate out of the office in the Science Wing.  Orientation was a huge success and Campus Safety took part in the events and festivities. UTSC hosted their second Homecoming which was another success. The Student Crisis Response Coordinator position evolved to the new title of Community Crisis Response Coordinator (CCRC) to better reflect the work being done. Through the course of 2023 Campus Safety continued to pave the way as a leader within the University and College sector in how we respond to those experiencing mental health concerns. The CCRC was embedded within Special Constable hiring processes and departmental policies were updated and amended to reflect the CCRC as the leader on Mental Health calls for service. This was done to minimize the presence of uniformed officers needed to attend in times of personal crises. This has remained a priority for our community.  Campus Safety has continued to engage with the UTSC community through various community-based initiatives. Campus Safety requires that their Special Constables each implement one initiative in each of the Fall and Winter semesters in addition to the many other events that Campus Safety is invited to participate in. In 2023, we saw an increased demand in safety planning and individualized services in response to the incident that took place at the University of Waterloo. Campus Safety managed these requests on a case-by-case basis to support the community. Criminal statistics and general reports have remained within a reasonable threshold. Calls for service to assist our community members increased, particularly concerning access to various areas of campus. The University of Toronto Scarborough Campus Safety team provides effective support to our community, ensuring that prescribed service standards are met while ensuring that the administration, promotion, and support of professionalism are upheld. These standards include the practices, conduct, appearance, ethics, and integrity of its members, to strengthen public confidence and cooperation within the community. Criminal statistics and general reports have \f    3  remained within reasonable levels in 2023. The number of calls for service, however, decreased from 4,521 to 2,907 during 2023, and the number of reports has increased from 563 to 723. These statistics also do not reflect the informal and impromptu contacts the officers have with members of the University community, which also contribute to an enhanced sense of personal safety. UTSC Committee Participation  Members of Campus Safety management and front-line personnel participate in various committees on campus, many of which focus on providing a safe environment for our students, faculty, and staff.  Other committees are efforts to increase the level of engagement with members of marginalized communities.  • Campus Safety continues its partnership with the Office of Student Experience and Wellbeing (OSEW) and Scarborough Campus Student Union (SCSU) during Orientation activities, allowing the opportunity to remove barriers between students and Campus Safety members. Campus Safety management also works with OSEW and SCSU to provide financial support and strategic approaches to ensure safety during various Orientation events. • Campus Safety participates in the Student Welfare Committee, comprised of Managers and Directors who collaborate to case manage situations of students at risk, to ensure that they receive the support necessary to increase their chances of success in their educational endeavors, while also ensuring community safety. • Campus Safety co-chairs the Risk Assessment Committee: this is a committee comprised of management and student representatives that identify and mitigate personal and physical risks associated with events held on campus, thereby ensuring the success and safety of the participants during the event. • Leadership, Education and Development (LEAD) program: The Senior Director, Assistant Director, and Community Crisis Response Coordinator participates in this initiative as a mentor and is paired with a mentee throughout the program, which ran from September 2023 to May 2024. Mentees met with their mentors to focus on topics of interest and to learn from their mentor’s experience and wisdom. • Operational Response Team: Campus Safety participated in this committee which focuses on business continuity in response to events that take place on campus to ensure operations are not impacted. • Study Space Committee: This committee is comprised of various stakeholders within the UTSC community such as Facilities Management, SCSU, Retail and Conference Services, Information and Instructional Technology Services and others. The committee is in place to ensure students at UTSC have safe and adequate space on campus in which to study effectively.   \f    4  Community Safety Initiatives Community initiatives and engagement is the essence of what Campus Safety does and continues to remain a key priority for our team. Campus Safety participated in a wide variety of community safety initiatives in 2023, including: • Ball Hockey • Badminton • Bubble Tea with Campus Safety • Christmas Toy Drive • Children’s Holiday Party (for Staff & Faculty) • De-escalation Training for various departments • Donation Drive in collaboration with Blankets for T.O. • EHS Workplace Violence Audits • Get Started - Orientation & Training • Green Path Orientation • Grand Iftar in collaboration with the Muslim Student Association • Homecoming • International Student Centre SIN clinic • International Students Orientation • City of Toronto Mayoral Debate • UTSC Orientation • Prep Yourself - Safety Orientation for first-year students • Remembrance Day • Residence Life Team Training • Safety in Residence Seminar • Treats on the Beat • Urban Self-Defense • UTSC Camp Safety Talks • Wellness Fair Moving Forward   The University of Toronto Scarborough Campus Safety will continue its reactive and proactive strategies to both identify safety concerns and implement strategies that help us to better serve our community and continue our relationship with the Toronto Police Service. We are extremely invested in community-based safety by partnering with our community and look forward to continuing with current partnerships and in establishing new partnerships in the coming year.   \f    5  Organization, Statistics and Mandatory Reporting  Supervision  The Assistant Director, UTSC Campus Safety (Special Constables) reports to the Senior Director of Campus Safety Operations, who in turn reports to the Chief Administrative Officer. The Assistant Director and the Staff Sergeants of the UTSC Special Constable Service are responsible for the management, training and general supervision of all Corporals and Special Constables, while the Corporals are responsible for the supervision of the Special Constables on duty. Managers are generally on duty from 7:00 A.M. – 7:00 P.M. Monday to Friday and are on call at other times. There is a Corporal or Acting Corporal on duty 24/7/365 who is designated as the shift supervisor and is responsible for supervising between one and four officers as well as our Building Patrollers.  Staffing  In 2023, two Special Constables left the University to pursue a career with local Police Services or Special Constable agencies. Five new Special Constables were hired in 2023 with two set to start employment in January 2024. These changes resulted in UTSC Campus Safety operating below full strength as of December 31st, 2023. Campus Safety is working on hiring to fill these vacant positions.  Campus Safety management continues to work with the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Office and Human Resources to improve recruitment processes. We continue to strive to have our members reflect the UTSC community.  Campus Safety also employs six Building Patrollers (licensed security guards) who complement the Special Constables in providing safety and security in our community. The Building Patrollers also play a key role in ensuring a safe environment assisting with access calls, alarm response, general campus patrols and personal safety escorts on campus for those who feel vulnerable. In 2023, two new Building Patrollers were hired, and one Building Patroller was hired to the position of Special Constable. Currently, Campus Safety is in the recruitment process to fill the vacant position.  Campus Safety continues to employ a Community Crisis Response Coordinator. Campus Safety has continued to develop additional ways to provide support to the community related to providing mental health support to those in crisis. Campus Safety has enlisted the help of the Experiential Learning office and several students worked with the CCRC during the Fall semester to develop a peer crisis support program as part of an experiential learning academic course. In December, two students started the Peer Support program, the result of all the hard work and planning.  Campus Safety continues to look at ways to be part of the academic learning that takes place at UTSC by providing opportunities to students. \f    6   Organizational Chart       \f    7  Special Constable Appointments  Number of Total Applications (January 1st-December 31st) Number of New Appointments (January 1st-December 31st) Number of Re-Appointments (January 1st-December 31st) Total Number of Special Constables (As of December 31st) 5 3 2 16 Terminations/ Suspensions/ Resignations and Retirements  Number of Terminations (January 1st-December 31st) Number of Suspensions (January 1st-December 31st) Number of Resignations (January 1st-December 31st) Number of Retirements (January1st-December 31st) 0 0 2 0 Training University of Toronto Scarborough Campus Safety is committed to continuous professional development through front-line training for officers, reflective of the diverse needs and expectations of the University community. Our training is also designed to meet the needs of the UTSC community and directives from the Toronto Police Service Board. The training program is developed through consultation with the community, other institutions, and debriefing of situations, with a strong emphasis on diversity and unconscious bias components. Training resources are drawn from several areas, including the University’s Centre for Learning, Leadership and Culture (LLC), internal mentorship and supervision, the Canadian Police Knowledge Network, the Toronto Police Service, the Ontario Police College, and our external trainers including TNT Justice Consultants. Recommendations from all levels of police personnel contribute to the process of designing courses to meet the specific needs of Campus Safety and our community. The training curriculum is designed to ensure a balanced mix of mandatory skills training, sensitivity to a university environment, and practical field experience. The use of classroom lectures, seminars, and participation in group discussions is framed about campus safety situations. Campus resources are used where possible, but due to the unique challenges of a campus setting, outside resources are occasionally used as well. Campus Safety Management continues to evaluate their training providers on an ongoing basis to ensure that training is up to university standards, and that training is delivered to members with an embedded EDIO lens.  ** In instances where one person has completed training, it is either due to the course being optional or other staff have already taken it. \f    8   Mandatory Training  Subject Matter Delivered By Duration Number Receiving Training Total Hours Annual Use of Force Recertification U of T 8 hours 13 104 First Aid, CPR St. John Ambulance 16 hours 4 64 *All officers have current first aid/CPR certification.

None of the officers are issued oleoresin capsicum spray or foam. Crime, Traffic & Order Management  The statistics included in these tables do not reflect the total workload of the Campus Safety Special Constables. Proactive patrolling still accounts for most of the time spent by officers during their tour of duty.  Officers therefore account for many self-generated Calls-For-Service, many of which involve checking and patrolling specific locations on campus to ensure safety.  In 2023, Campus Safety Special Constables generated or responded to 2,907 calls for service which resulted in the submission of 723 reports.  These statistics also do not reflect the informal and impromptu contacts the officers have with members of the University community, which also contribute to an enhanced sense of personal safety.

As of December 31st, 2023, there were 171 sworn members within the Community Safety Unit (CSU).   The objectives of the program are to:   strengthen relationships between the CSU and the Toronto Police Service (TPS),  reduce the level of crime/antisocial behavior in Toronto Community Housing (TCHC) communities,  enhance law enforcement activities as required,  improve residents’ feelings of safety, security, and overall community safety and well-being,  ensure officers are able to spend more time in TCHC communities, and  improve officer safety.  Having Special Constables allows TCHC to move well-trained and qualified officers into situations that are particularly unique to TCHC communities.  Special Constables are sworn Peace Officers and are granted authority to enforce the following provincial and federal statutes:   Criminal Code of Canada,  Controlled Drugs and Substances Act,  Trespass to Property Act,  Liquor License & Control Act and,  Mental Health Act.   The Special Constable agreement between the TCHC Board and the Toronto Police Services Board (TPSB) has created a strong partnership reaching back over many years. This relationship has supported communication and co-operation between our organizations to the benefit of all.  As a result of the enhanced training, statutory authority, and access to information available to Special Constables, they have been able to support and assist TPS and TCHC residents with hundreds of investigations.      In 2023, TCHC Special Constables completed 1,557 Criminal investigations on behalf of the Toronto Police Service, of which 71% were related to property offences such as mischief and theft.   Last year, TCHC Special Constables conducted investigations for theft, mischief, assaults, and other less serious violent matters.  In instances involving major crimes, they have been the first officers on scene, assisting with primary assessments, notifications, scene protection, crowd control, witness canvassing, evidence security, and prisoner transports.     \f 3   TCHC Special Constables and TPS Officers jointly investigated many incidents. The combination of a Special Constables’ local community knowledge combined with the resources and specialized investigative ability of TPS Officers has proven to be mutually supportive, allowing incidents and problems to be resolved professionally in a safe and timely manner.   Our communities benefit when TCHC Special Constables are able to:  1. Process minor offences and release prisoners on scene without consuming TPS resources and holding persons in custody for longer than required.   2. Apprehend offenders and wanted persons; and transport them to local TPS Divisions for processing.  By doing so, they interrupt illegal and antisocial behavior, and help keep the peace in our neighborhoods while allowing TPS to deploy their resources more effectively to where they are needed most.  3. Support TPS not only with factual information, but also with detailed intelligence about criminal activity within TCHC communities.   The Toronto Community Housing Corporation, Community Safety Unit values and strives to enhance our working partnership with TPS and our joint Special Constable Memorandum of Understanding.  In 2023, the TCHC Special Constable Program continued to promote safe, secure, and healthy communities.                           \f 4    Background  Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) is the largest social housing provider in Canada and the second largest in North America. It provides affordable rental housing to about 58,500 low and moderate-income households, including seniors, families, singles, refugees, recent immigrants to Canada, and people with special needs. Government funding subsidizing TCHC's operations is administered by the City's Shelter, Support and Housing Administration division acting as the Service Manager under the Housing Services Act.   TCHC is incorporated under the Ontario Business Corporations Act, with the City of Toronto as its sole shareholder. TCHC’s Board is made up of three City Councillors, one of whom is appointed as the Mayor’s designate, ten citizens, including three TCHC tenants.  All citizen appointees are recommended for appointment by the City of Toronto’s Corporations Nominating Panel and approved by Toronto City Council.   In 2023, the CSU employed 228 professionals who performed a variety of functions. These included: Special Constables, Special Constables in Training, Parking Enforcement Officers, Dispatchers, Community Safety Advisors, Managers and other support staff.  As all of our communities are diverse and unique, each position was designed with different authorities and resources to help address those needs.    The Community Safety Unit’s mandate and vision express our role in helping to accomplish the goals of Toronto Community Housing. The mandate of the CSU is to partner with communities, promote community safety and well-being for residents, and preserve the assets of Toronto Community Housing.  In 2002, The Toronto Community Housing Board of Directors entered into agreement with the Toronto Police Services Board that allowed for the ongoing use of Special Constables as a core component of TCHC’s Community Safety Program.  In 2023, there were 171 CSU staff deployed as sworn Special Constables (including Supervisors and all Management staff), with the approval of the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. This report provides an overview of our Special Constable program in 2023.  Unit Structure As of December 31st, 2023, the CSU had 10 Managers, and 19 Field Supervisors with Special Constable status, who oversaw operations 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The CSU had 117 Special Constables, 16 Special Constables in Training, 7 Parking Enforcement Officers and 15 Dispatchers. They were all supported by 1 Senior Director, 2 Senior Managers, 1 Specialist in Compliance, Training and Investigations, 1 Specialist in Quality Assurance and Records Management, 1 Dispatch Manager, 4 Dispatch Supervisors, 1 Parking Coordinator, 2 Administrative Assistants, 5 Clerks, 1 Criminal Intelligence Analyst, 5 Field Intelligence Officers, 11 Community Safety Advisors, 1 Program Manager for Access Control, 1 Access Control Field Administrator and 1 Coordinator of Systems and Procurement.

Any seized property required for cases under investigation by the Toronto Police Service were immediately forwarded to TPS for storage and/or evidence.  All other seizures (drugs, cash, weapons and found property) were surrendered directly to the TPS at the time of the initial investigation, including completion of the applicable reports, TPS property processing procedures, and in compliance with our Special Constable MOU.    Naloxone  Opioid-related deaths continue to be on the rise in the City of Toronto, and have increased substantially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic2. Naloxone is a life-saving medication which can be used to temporarily counteract an opioid overdose and prevent an overdose death, providing life-saving assistance while waiting for medical personnel to attend. In 2020, the use of Narcan® brand (naloxone) nasal spray was introduced in the CSU with TPS approval. Each naloxone nasal spray kit contains 2 doses of naloxone nasal spray (4mg/0.1ml). It was administered a total of 15 times from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.   Training of designated CSU employees first began in May 2020, with naloxone spray kits being deployed as of June 2020. Naloxone training is also part of the first aid recertification course provided by Workplace Medical. All Special Constables in Training receive naloxone training through both a CPKN course, as well as through first aid training.   Public Complaints  As required by the agreement between Toronto Community Housing Board of Directors and the Toronto Police Services Board, TCHC has established a complaint investigation procedure for Special Constables which corresponds with the procedure used by the TPS. TCHC provides a quarterly report of all complaints and their investigations to the Toronto Police Services Board. Any findings of misconduct are reported forthwith.   There were 6 public complaints, and 2 internal complaints submitted to the Community Safety Unit in 2023. A public complaint is defined by the complaint being received from a member of the public or directly affecting a member of the public. An internal complaint points to a complaint that originated internally, or by extension, from TPS.   One of the public complaints is currently under investigation by PRS. At this time, the Subject Officer’s employment and Special Constable designation have been suspended by TCHC and the   Toronto Police Services Board as the investigation is ongoing. Four public complaints investigated by TCHC were found to be unsubstantiated and one was substantiated; all are closed. One of the  2 https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/sciencebrief/the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-opioid-related-harm-in-ontario/  \f 16  two internal complaints is being investigated by TCHC and the other has been unsubstantiated and closed.   The 2019 Ombudsman’s Report3 relevant to Special Constable complaint investigations was adopted and the Complaints Investigator position was created for CSU complaints. This position is now housed under the Legal Division, which is a separate unit from CSU.  The hiring and implementation was initiated in Q4 2020, and the Complaints Investigator commenced their role in Q1 2021.  Total Number of Complaints Investigated by TCHC Complaints Investigator Investigated by Toronto Police Service Number Resolved Number Outstanding 8 626 2 Use of Force   In 2023, 11 Use of Force reports were completed by TCHC Special Constables.

TCHC Special Constables are fully conversant with the laws and regulations governing enforcement authorities pertaining to their designation.   The CSU has supervisors and managers who hold the status of Special Constable and are responsible for the appearance, conduct, discipline and performance of all officers. All Special Constables understand the contract agreement between Toronto Community Housing Board of Directors and Toronto Police Services Board as well as the expectations concerning their conduct and/or job performance.   TPS 2023 Annual Report – Highlights   Special Constable Designations  On December 18th, 2018, the Toronto Police Services Board approved TCHC’s application to increase its allowable complement of Special Constables from 160 to 300 designations.    In 2023, the CSU continued with its recruitment strategy and hired 32 new frontline patrol officers. Other new hires with Special Constable Status include 1 Training Corporal, and 1 Project Manager for Body Worn Cameras, 1 Dispatcher, 1 Parking Enforcement Officer and 1 Parking Clerk. In 2023, there were two developmental cycles, one of which has been successfully completed and the other will be completed by Q1 of 2024. These cycles are six months in length. The CSU recruitment strategy is aimed at improving consistency and collaboration between TCHC and TPS to ultimately benefit the tenants and communities we both serve.    Violence Reduction Program  CSU VRP Special Constables continued to work with internal and external partners to find solutions for tenant issues and challenges. CSU VRP officers attended weekly Integrated Team Meetings with TCHC’s Safety and Support team members and onsite staff, which provided a holistic approach to solving issues within the community. The safety of the community is \f 18  paramount and is something CSU VRP officers strive to achieve daily through proactive engagement, planning and safety strategies.  In 2023, VRP Special Constables attended approximately 55 Integrated Team Meetings which included internal and external partners, as well as some community leaders. VRP Special Constables participated in approximately 100 community events in 2023.   2023 VRP Summary Community Calls For Service CSU Patrol Community Calls For ServicePatrols Bleecker/200 Wellesley 38861252 Dan Harrison / William Dennison 2025969 Edgeley Village 5141271 Flemingdon Park/Glenyan Manor 54464 Islington/St. Andrews 26824 Jane/Falstaff 18681063 Lawrence 28271917 Lawrence Heights 11851084 Moss Park 27261366 Regent Park/Gerrard River 20951189 Victoria Park/Chester Le Blvd 32848 Total 1826610247   CSU Community Initiatives  In 2023, the CSU organized 310 resident community engagement activities.

CSU Turkey Giveaway: CSU led the charge, working collaboratively with Operations to make the holiday season brighter for 6,800 TCHC Tenants and 3,300 non-tenants through donations of food, hygiene items, gift cards, toys and warm winter clothing.  The food donations also benefited Food Banks operating on TCHC’s properties, shelters and at Community Dinners.  In 2023, our members and TPS gathered donations of approximately 1,500 frozen turkeys 1,200 hams and 9,000lbs of potatoes to give to tenants in our VRP communities thanks to generous donations from No Frills  CSU Christmas Comes Early: Community Safety Unit members, including VRP officers and CSAs served approximately 1,000 hamburgers, hundreds of sandwiches, soup and distributed clothing to members of our downtown communities around Moss Park. Also, new pajamas were provided to the children in the Firgrove Boys and Girls Club. This year, there were over 2000 people who attended CSU’s Christmas Comes Early in Moss Park event.      \f 19  Toronto Star Box Deliveries: This annual tradition provides TCHC tenants in VRP communities, boxes filled with personal essential items and small toys for children donated by The Toronto Star.  In 2023, approximately   1,800 gift boxes and other items such as knitted mitts and hats were donated and distributed by our officers.  Jane-Finch Gives Back – held at Jane-Finch Mall CSU donated gift cards, new toys, winter clothing and baby food for the Jane-Finch Gives Back event.   All donated items were distributed to families in need in the nearby community, for both TCHC and private residences.   Lawrence East Partnership Program CSU’s Special Constables, Community Safety Advisors and site staff assisted in the preparation of a holiday dinner and karaoke for 35 tenants at 4205 Lawrence Avenue East.  Back to School Backpack Giveaway CSU Special Constables and CSAs participated in the Back to School Backpack giveaway throughout the city on TCHC properties.   Safeplay Special Constables from our VRP and CSA team along with TPS worked together to provide a safe space for children and families to play in the Shoreham, Driftwood and Grandravine communities.  This was the third year that CSU participated in this program where sports equipment and arts and crafts were donated and distributed to allow families to enjoy the outdoors and have a safe space to meet.  Bike Rodeos CSU worked in conjunction with TPS to hold bike rodeos in the Yorkwoods, Parma Court and Neptune TCHC communities.  Bike safety, tune-ups and donated bikes were provided to the tenants at these properties.    CSU Ontario Police Technology Information Co-Operative (OPTIC) NICHE Record Management System (RMS) Project  CSU’s OPTIC NICHE RMS project began in 2022 having the Privacy Impact Assessment reviewed and approved for joining OPTIC, utilizing NICHE as our Records Management System. CSU and OPTIC have continued to meet on a bi-weekly basis to mobilize Niche implementation. CSU has partnered with FSET (third party IT provider) to maintain a secure connection to the OPTIC network and Niche environment.   Over the course of 2023, the Niche Domain Administration Team was responsible for completing the following:    Facilitating the enhanced background clearance process for all civilian members who did not have background checks completed by the Toronto Police Service,   Reviewing current business practices and mapping our processes to Niche RMS, \f 20   Completing the Niche RMS domain configuration,  Identifying and training Subject Matter Expert and Train the Trainer groups,  Developing the end user training program,  Scheduling and training all CSU members that require access to Niche RMS as part of their daily duties,  Updating and configuring the CSU Dispatch Application to integrate with Niche RMS.  CSU is targeting a go-live date within Q1 of 2024. At this time, the current record management system will be retired, and CSU will be fully operational within the Niche RMS environment and a standing member of the OPTIC cooperative.   Peer Support Training  The CSU, in collaboration with TCHC’s Learning and Organizational Development unit, hosted a comprehensive two-day Peer Support Training in December 2023. This training included three CSU staff as well as staff from other TCHC operating units. The Peer Support Team plans on hosting a larger training in the fall of 2024.   Following the resignation of our Peer Support Leader last year, two new Leaders were appointed: one Special Constable, and one Dispatcher. These Leaders will provide ongoing support to the Peer Support Team. They will be an advocate for the program and will be responsible for the continuous promotion and awareness of the program across the CSU. The CSU currently has 28 peer support trained staff.   Combatting Anti-Black Racism Strategy  TCHC’s 2021 Combatting Anti-Black Racism Strategy “CABR” supports racialized and marginalized communities throughout TCHC through an Anti-Black Racism lens on policies, procedures, practices and provide enhanced training to all staff.  As a key stakeholder, the CSU has worked towards implementing key action items in the CABR Strategy report. The CSU involves TCHC’s Centre for Advancing the Interests of Black People, known as “The Centre” in all policy and procedural changes to ensure that a CABR lens is applied, and also receives support on improving the employee life cycle for Black staff.  In 2023, CSU worked to implement a “Cadet” program to break down barriers for young Black tenants in finding meaningful employment while also learning about the various career opportunities in the CSU and TCHC. It is anticipated that the youth will be hired in 2024.  The CSU also began exploration into the implementation of a Body Worn Camera program. The CSU and “The Centre” plan on actively engaging with tenants, staff, and other key stakeholders in determining the positives and negatives of a BWC program before submitting a business case to the TCHC Board of Directors.  \f 21  Other CABR action items we continue to work on are aligning services with the TCHC HUB model, providing increased education for the CSU to racialized and marginalized communities, as well as the CSU Black Employee Life Cycle.   CSU/TPS Joint Patrols   Between January 1st, 2023, and December 31st, 2023, TCHC Special Constables and TPS participated in 274 joint patrols and walk-throughs in our communities.  This initiative focused on deterring anti-social behaviour on Toronto Community Housing properties.    Vehicles  The CSU vehicles anticipated to arrive in 2023 were not received due to a global shortage related to COVID 19. CSU continued to deliver service to tenants utilizing 68 TCHC Fleet Vehicles comprised of Ford Explorers, Dodge Chargers, and Ford Taurus’s. In 2024, CSU is anticipating the arrival of 13 new 2023 Ford Explorer Hybrid vehicles to replace our aging and high mileage fleet vehicles.    Incident Response Training Unit  In 2020, CSU internalized Special Constable training from a contracted model. TCHC CSU staffed the training unit with experienced topical professionals. The training unit consists of one training Staff Sergeant, an Incident Response Instructor (Use of Force), and an Incident Response Instructor (Academics), both holding the rank of Corporal. This was done in accordance with the existing MOU and all training initiatives are approved by TPS on behalf of the Toronto Police Services Board.   In 2023, the unit trained two recruit classes and one coach officer course was facilitated. The unit recertified the annual use of force training for all Special Constables in compliance with the MOU, as well as ensured all first aid certifications were recertified as required.    Conclusion  This report complies with TCHC’s Special Constable Memorandum of Understanding with TPS.

The Special Constable Service Department implemented initiatives that support the Culture Change Program to ensure that the delivery of Special Constable duties are provided in an equitable, inclusive, respectful and safe manner. The Culture Change Program’s overarching pillars include:1. Structure for success to create and support a diverse and inclusive workforce. 2. Modernization of policy, procedures, standards and programs.3. Update technologies. 4. Overhauling of training and monitoring systems.  Contributing to the continued progress of  the Culture Change Program’s first pillar of creating a structure for success, the Special Constable Service recruited 42 Special Constables in 2023 through bias-free and inclusive hiring practices. This has resulted  in three graduating classes of Special Constables representing the highest level of diversity from racialized groups. The Special Constable Service’s recruitment efforts aim  at further strengthening the department’s presence in the transit system, while also embracing diversity to make the TTC more effective, innovative and equitable. With this initiative, the TTC is improving its ability to respond to security-related incidents, while also supporting the Culture Change Program’s objective of fostering a diverse  and inclusive workforce.  In addition, the Special Constable Service and Revenue Protection departments supported the Culture Change Program’s second pillar of modernizing policy, procedures, standards and programs  by making significant progress in the development of the new and updated Use  of Force, Use of Discretion and Body-Worn Camera and Special Constable In-Car Camera System policies. The policies are intended to strengthen accountability and public trust in enforcement activities and  are being developed in response to recommendations made by the Ombudsman Toronto in their report that was issued on April 20, 2017, called, An Investigation into the Toronto Transit Commission’s Oversight of its Transit Enforcement Unit. The Ombudsman provided a total of 26 recommendations in their report in which 15 recommendations have been implemented to date. Board approval of the proposed policies will  bring the total number of implemented recommendations to 24. By aligning with third-party report recommendations, the TTC is ensuring that all policies and procedures  in place promote fair and equitable treatment of customers.The Special Constable Service department is contributing to the Culture Change Program’s third pillar of updating technologies through body-worn cameras and in-car cameras. In Q1 2024, the Special Constable Service SPECIAL CONSTABLE SERVICE  ANNUAL REPORT 2023  |  ExECUTIVE SUmmARy – 3\fDepartment will be launching a pilot to equip Special Constables with body-worn cameras along with in-car cameras in Special Constable patrol vehicles. Body-worn cameras and Special Constable in-car cameras are intended to increase accountability and transparency in enforcement and customer engagement to deliver bias-free service and ensure public trust. The pilot will prioritize transit safety, security, and revenue protection, underlining the TTC’s commitment to excellence.Recognizing the historical systemic barriers that marginalized communities have faced in accessing public transportation, the TTC is addressing the Culture Change Program’s fourth pillar of overhauling training and monitoring systems. In 2023, all Special Constables participated in a two-day, in-person training program on the Use of Discretion and Use of Force policies that were developed for the Special Constable Service and Revenue Protection departments. The Special Constable Service remains steadfast in its duty to fostering a safe and inclusive environment for all TTC riders and employees by ensuring that Special Constables receive training that focuses on combatting conscious  and unconscious bias in the execution of  their duties. 4 – ExECUTIVE SUmmARy  |  SPECIAL CONSTABLE SERVICE  ANNUAL REPORT 2023\fCulture Change  ProgramIn 2023, the Culture Change Program continued to serve as the cornerstone for all work carried out by staff from the Special Constable Service Department. The Culture Change Program’s objective is to ensure that safety, security, and revenue protection services are customer-focused, founded in equity, respect, and dignity for both customers and employees. This includes communities that historically and presently face systemic barriers.Both departments have worked toward transformative internal and external changes to demonstrate their commitment to accountability, transparency, building public trust, addressing regulatory concerns, and ensuring bias-free service delivery.

The following Ontario regulations supplement the sections of the Act that govern Special Constables: • O.Reg- 396/23: Matters Respecting the Appointment & Functions of Special Constables & the Authorization of Special Constable Employers• O.Reg- 410/23: Code of Conduct for Special Constables• O.Reg- 411/23: Complaints about Special Constables• O.Reg- 416/23: Oaths and AffirmationsThe Community Safety and Policing Act will uphold Special Constables to legislative standards set out by the Province of Ontario and will come into force on April 1, 2024. TTC Updated Policies In 2023, the Special Constable Service and Revenue Protection departments made significant progress on the implementation of the new and updated Use of Force, Use of Discretion and Body-Worn Camera and Special Constable In-Car Camera System policies by conducting internal and external consultations with diverse stakeholders. The policies aim to address recommendations issued in a report by the Ombudsman Toronto on April 20, 2017 that investigated an incident involving two TTC employees and two members of the public on January 29, 2015. The implementation of the policies will achieve the following recommendations made in the Ombudsman Toronto’s report:• Amending the Use of Force Policy to clearly outline the importance of de-escalation as an alternative to the use of physical force.  • Creating a policy on the exercise of discretion by Special Constables and Fare Inspectors to use their authority.  • Installing video recording cameras in all Special Constable patrol cars and; • Amending corporate policy and procedures on video recording in public areas to reflect the use of video recording cameras in Special Constable patrol cars. The departments conducted consultations in 2023 with expert stakeholders, community stakeholders, and the general public to develop the policies. The departments sought review of the policies by expert stakeholders, Arleen Huggins, the TTC’s External Advisor on Diversity and Inclusion, and Professors from the University of Toronto, Dr. Akwasi  Owusu-Bempah and Dr. Scot Wortley. The Use of Force and Use of Discretion policies were also reviewed by key stakeholders, such as the City of Toronto’s Confronting Anti-Black Racism Unit and the Indigenous Affairs Office. Sixteen community consultations  were also conducted as part of the Racial Equity Impact Assessment (REIA) by  \f16 – mODERNIzE POLICIES, PROCEDURES, STANDARDS AND PROgRAmS   |  SPECIAL CONSTABLE SERVICE  ANNUAL REPORT 2023Dr. Owusu-Bempah and Dr. Wortley to garner feedback on the policies. The consultations targeted members of Toronto’s Black and Indigenous communities, including Black Legal Action Centre, Conference of Minority Transportation Officials, East Scarborough Boys and Girls Club, Urban Alliance on Race Relations, and more. Public consultations were conducted through a survey developed by Drs. Wortley and Owusu-Bempah that were distributed to TTC customers to gain better insight into TTC customer and employee experiences with Special Constables. The departments also consulted with the Ombudsman Toronto and CUPE 5089 to obtain their review and feedback on the policies. Through these collaborative efforts, the Special Constable Service and Revenue Protection departments made significant strides in the development of the policies and aim to have them in place for Special Constables and Fare Inspectors in 2024. Use of force PolicyThe updated Use of Force Policy is intended to establish guidelines for when force is used by Special Constables, Fare Inspectors and Protective Services Guards during the course of their duties, and detail reporting responsibilities for when force and excessive force is used. The policy serves to operationalize the TTC’s commitment to customer service, safety and fare compliance through communication, education and de-escalation techniques designed to minimize physical harm and the number of incidents where Special Constables are required to use force. Through the Use of Force Policy, Special Constables are only authorized to use force as a last resort and only after completing training, which incorporates various de-escalation techniques (e.g. active listening and conflict resolution using effective communication), mental health awareness, unconscious bias and in accordance with the Ontario Use of Force Model. Fare Inspectors and Protective Services Guards are only permitted to use force for the purposes of self-defence as permitted under section 25 of the Criminal Code.  Use of Discretion PolicyThe Use of Discretion Policy is intended to outline guiding principles for Special Constables, Fare Inspectors and Protective Services Guards when performing enforcement, fare inspection and compliance duties. When using discretion, employees are directed to consider factors, including, but not limited to:   1. Seriousness and nature of the offence; 2. Context in which the offence takes place;  3. Likelihood of a written warning deterring the person from committing future violations; 4. Behaviour that may be the result of a disability or other grounds protected by the Ontario Human Rights Code; and 5. Role and impact of both conscious and unconscious bias on decision-making; and other factors that are appropriate to consider.Body-Worn Camera and Special Constable In-Car Camera System PolicyThe Body-Worn Camera and Special Constable In-Car Camera System Policy is intended to support a pilot that will equip 20 Fare Inspectors and 20 Special Constables with body-worn cameras and 14 Special Constable patrol vehicles with in-car cameras in 2024. The policy supports the TTC’s partnership approach to community safety, security and well-being on public transit by endorsing the body-worn cameras and in-car camera systems to increase transparency and accountability.\fUpdate TechnologiesOver the past year, the Special Constable Service initiated several projects that contribute to the TTC’s commitment to enhancing transparency and accountability, while promoting a culture of safety and integrity. Initiatives to implement body-worn cameras, in-car camera systems, Mobile Ticketing and updated Hand-Held Point of Sale devices are underway to integrate innovative technologies that will enhance how Special Constable perform their duties.Body-Worn Camera and Special Constable In-Car Camera System PilotIn 2023, the Special Constable Service and Revenue Protection departments developed an implementation plan for a Body-Worn Camera and Special Constable In-Car Camera pilot program in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders. The pilot will equip 20 Special Constables and 20 Fare Inspectors with body-worn cameras and all 14 Special Constable patrol vehicles with in-car cameras. This phased implementation plan will rotate body-worn cameras among  all Special Constables and Fare Inspectors  by equipping them with the devices during  a six-week period. Through this phased approach, all Officers will have the opportunity to be equipped with a body-worn camera during the pilot. The pilot is expected to launch in Q2 2024. The implementation of body-worn cameras is a testament to the TTC’s dedication to transparency, accountability and the enhancement of public trust. By using body-worn cameras during the execution of enforcement, fare inspection and compliance tasks, the department’s aim to ensure the delivery of unbiased services. In addition to improving customer and employee safety, body-worn cameras and in-car cameras facilitate the establishment of employee accountability and enhance the collection of evidence. This initiative underscores the TTC’s commitment to upholding the highest standards of professionalism and integrity in its operations, while enhancing the quality of its services.Once the pilot begins, the Special Constable Service and Revenue Protection departments will gather feedback from Supervisors, Special Constables and Fare Inspectors on the process and application of the equipment to identify the benefits and possible issues associated with the use of the equipment. The outcomes of the pilot will determine if full deployment of cameras will be issued to all Special Constables and Fare Inspectors. hand-held Point of Sale Device Refresh In collaboration with the Farecard Team and the Strategy and Foresight Department, team members are working with Metrolinx to find a modernized solution to replace the existing hand-held point of sale (inspection) device.

The department also continued to provide recruitment and refresher training aimed at providing Special Constables with best practices in addressing customers and employees with respect, sensitivity, and without bias. In addition, the Special Constable Service’s training department was moved to the TTC’s Operational Training Centre where all staff across the TTC receive training. Through this restructuring, training will be provided at improved facilities and will be centralized to align with TTC training standards.Use of force and Use of Discretion TrainingIn 2023, all Special Constables participated in a two-day, in-person training program on the proposed Use of Force and Use of Discretion policies that were developed for the Special Constable Service and Revenue Protection departments. The first day of training was led by University of Toronto Professors Dr. Akwasi Owusu-Bempah and Dr. Scot Wortley and staff from the TTC’s Racial Equity Office. The training focused on:• Defining discretion and bias (conscious and unconscious); • Importance of race and gender identity in Canadian society; • Uses and potential misuses of race-based and gender identity data; and • Collection of race-based and gender identity data within the TTC.  The second day of training was led by the Special Constable’s Training Team.

In 2023, Special Constables seized and processed 64 pieces of property into their property vault.Compliance ReportingPublic Complaints For 2023, the TTC received a total of 25 public complaints involving Special Constables and 109 public complaints involving Fare Inspectors for a combined total of 134, which is an increase from 48 complaints received in 2022. The increase of complaints were directed primarily toward Fare Inspectors, likely due to the resumption of ticketing operations in March 2023. In 2022, Fare Inspectors applied a non-ticketing, educational approach due to financial constraints the public faced due to the pandemic. An update on public complaints received by the Fare Inspector and Special Constable Complaints Office in 2023 will be provided in the 2024 Diversity and Culture Group Annual Report. The Fare Inspector and Special Constable Complaints Office investigates concerns about TTC Fare Inspectors and Special Constables along with any related policies and services.Early Intervention Based on the recommendations of the Ombudsman Toronto, an Early Intervention 30 – OVERhAUL TRAININg AND mONITORINg SySTEmS  |  SPECIAL CONSTABLE SERVICE  ANNUAL REPORT 2023\fSystem was introduced in 2021 and a framework was launched in 2022 to monitor complaint trends and use of force incidents among Fare Inspectors, Special Constables and Protective Service Guards. The TTC’s Early Intervention System is a non-disciplinary management accountability tool designed to track and identify employees with identifiable patterns of problematic performance, and subject each employee to an intervention designed to correct his or her performance. The Early Intervention System will also recognize employees with positive exemplary performance. To identify employees whose performance warrants review and intervention, performance indicators, such as complaints, use of force reports, cautions/charges/summons, discipline records, body-worn/in-car camera non-compliance and recognition records are used. By using a combination of multiple performance indicators, the Early Intervention System can provide a broader base of information for identifying patterns of problematic performance among employees. The goal of the Early Intervention System is to detect any trends of problematic behaviour before the need for discipline arises, and provide intervention to employees in the form of evaluation, training/retraining and coaching.  The Early Intervention System framework for complaints has been developed while other performance indicators are still in the process of being developed in alignment with the new internal policies. The Special Constable Service and Revenue Protection departments are working with the Fare Inspector and Special Constable Complaints Office to collate the outcome of each complaint investigation into the system. When the information is up to date, statistics that relate to the Early Intervention will be provided accordingly. Completion of the Early Intervention System will address the remaining two Ombudsman recommendations. SPECIAL CONSTABLE SERVICE  ANNUAL REPORT 2023  |  OVERhAUL TRAININg AND mONITORINg SySTEmS – 31\fCompliance Reporting Use of force ReportingSpecial Constables are bound by Ontario Regulation 926/90, which compels Police Officers to submit a Use of Force Report (UFR Form 1) to the Chief of Police when a Police Officer who, when in the performance of their duties, uses force on another  person that results in an injury requiring medical attention or uses a weapon on another person.The TTC’s internal policy on reporting use of force by Special Constables uses a lower threshold.

This includes utilizing remote technology, such as video or telephone when applicable. The Ontario Court of Justice will 34 – OVERhAUL TRAININg AND mONITORINg SySTEmS  |  SPECIAL CONSTABLE SERVICE  ANNUAL REPORT 2023\fbe presented either in physical hearings, through remote technology (video or telephone), or a combination of both. In the city of Toronto, matters related to the Provincial Offences Act can be attended to either in person or through audio telephone or video conferencing options. Before attending any remote court proceedings, all participants must follow the Remote Appearance Code of Conduct of the Ontario Court of Justice to maintain a level of decorum expected in Ontario Court of Justice proceedings. Historically, criminal court cases have required in person attendance, however, during specific parts of the legal process, the defendant and their lawyer may be allowed to participate in court hearings through teleconference or platforms, such as Zoom. This decision is at the discretion of the Judicial Officer and may change. The Court will continue to collaborate with its justice partners to decide on the most effective way to apply technology in order to enhance court services and access to justice. Provincial Offence Notices IssuedIn 2023, the Special Constable Service issued 80 Provincial Offence Notices and four Provincial Offences Act Summons, 54 certificates more when compared to 2022  (30 Notices/Summons).

Fair and merit-based recruitment practices were used to hire 42 Special Constables, promoting diversity within its ranks. Consultations were conducted to develop new and updated Use of Force, Use of Discretion and Body-Worn Camera and Special Constable In-Car Camera System policies to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of customers. The framework for the Body-Worn Camera and Special Constable In-Car Camera System pilot was developed, which will equip Special Constables and Fare Inspectors with tools to provide public transparency and demonstrate accountability. Finally, all Special Constables participated in a two-day training program on the Use of Force and Use of Discretion policies, which focused on providing Special Constables with the tactics necessary to serve a diverse community with sensitivity and respect. By integrating the Culture Change Program’s pillars in all of its operations, the department continues to enhance accountability, transparency and public trust, underscoring the TTC’s commitment to excellence in providing safe, efficient, accessible and reliable transportation services for all.Moving forward, the Special Constable Service Department will continue to prioritize promoting equity, diversity and inclusion; and fostering a safe and inclusive environment for all employees and customers.Contact informationNicole Ehlers  Head – Special Constable Service (Acting)  Toronto Transit Commission  416-397-8929  nicole.ehlers@ttc.caTTC Special Constable Service – February 202442 – CONCLUSION  |  SPECIAL CONSTABLE SERVICE  ANNUAL REPORT 2023\f\f\fToronto Police Service Board40 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2J3|Phone: 416-808-8080   Fax: 416-808-8082 |www.tpsb.caPUBLIC REPORTMay 16, 2024To:Chair and MembersToronto Police Service BoardFrom:Myron DemkiwChief of PoliceSubject:Toronto Police Service applications to the 14 programs under the Province of Ontario Community Safety Project GrantsPurpose:☒Information Purposes Only☐Seeking DecisionSummary:At its meeting onFebruary 14, 2024, City Council passed a motion requesting the Toronto Police Service Board to provide a report prior to the 2025 Budget process, with a list of Toronto Police Service (Service) applications to the 14 programs under the Province of Ontario Community Safety Project Grants, and the dollar amounts.This report outlines which of the 14 programs under the Community Safety Project Grants the Service submitted applications to and the corresponding approved funding amountsfor each.Recommendation:This report recommends thatthe Toronto Police Service Board (Board) forward a copy of this report to the City of Toronto (City) Executive Committee for information.Financial Implications:Out of the 14 grants under theProvince of OntarioCommunity Safety Project Grants, the Service was deemed eligibleand appliedfor 10grants, securingapproximately $70.2M in grant funding for the 2023 –2024 Provincial fiscal year.\f2Discussion:BackgroundAt its meeting onFebruary 14, 2024, City Council passed the following motion:City Council request the Toronto Police Services Board to report prior to the 2025 Budget Process, with a list of Toronto Police Services applications to the 14 programs under the Province of Ontario Community Safety Project Grants, and the dollar amounts.As of March 31, 2024, the Service had a total of 19active grantswhich included ten grants under the Community Safety Project Grants Program for which the Service has been deemed eligible.

Applications for these 10grants have been successfuland the Service secured approximately $70.2M in provincial grant funding for the fiscal year 2023/24.It should be noted that grant funding fully or partially subsidizes the program or project for which a grant is intended, for a zero net impact to the budget.In the absence of this grant funding, the Service would not have carried out these projects and programs, or the annual operating budget would have tobe increased in order to deliver these services. For further information on the Service’s grants, please refer to the Service’s annual report on grant applications and contracts which outlines details on all of the Service’s active grants, grant applications submitted by the Service, new grants awarded and contracts signed by the Board Chair.It should be noted that even though the Court Security and Prisoner Transportation Program is listed under the Community Safety Project Grants Program, there is no formal application process for it.  The Province uses an expenditure-based funding model to determine the annual allocation for each municipality based on each municipality’s relative share of the total provincial court security and prisoner transportation costs.  Since there is no formal application for this Program, and the grant agreement is between the Province and the City of Toronto, not the Board, this grant is not included in the Service’s annual grant report.Similarly, the Waterloo Police Service is the lead on the Hate Crime and Extremism Investigative Team grant.  As such, the Waterloo Police Service submitted an application on behalf of 17 Ontario police services and signed the grant agreement with the Province.  The Waterloo Police Service willbe responsible for ensuring that all partnering police services, including the Toronto Police Service, receive their share of the grant funding in each year.  Since there is no formal application from the Service for this Program and the agreement is between the Province and the Waterloo Police Service, not the Board, this grant is not included in the Service’s annual grant report.Information for the grant term beginning fiscal year 2024/25 is not yet available.\f\f\f\fConclusion:This report provides the Board with information on which of the 14 programs under the Community Safety Project Grants the Service submitted applications to, and the approved funding amountsreceived. Ms. Svina Dhaliwal, Chief Administrative Officer, willbe in attendance to answer any questions the Board may have regarding this report.Respectfully submitted,Myron Demkiw, M.O.M.Chief of Police\fToronto Police Service Board40 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2J3|Phone: 416-808-8080   Fax: 416-808-8082 |www.tpsb.caPUBLIC REPORTMay 15, 2024To:Chair and MembersToronto Police Service BoardFrom:Dubi KanengisserExecutive Director Subject:ProposedRevisions to Board’s Procedural By-Law Purpose:☐Information Purposes Only☒Seeking DecisionSummary:This report presents and discussesproposed changes to the Board’s Procedural By-law. These proposed changes incorporate revisions required pursuant to the new Community Safety and Policing Act, along with additional changes identified by Board Office Staff, in consultation with Board Members, to make Board meetings more efficient and effective.Discussion:BackgroundThe Board's Procedural By-law (By-law) was enacted in 1996,and was updated and expanded in 2017 (Min. No. P33/17 refers).  The Procedural By-law governs the meetings of the Board (both Regular and Specialmeetings),as well asall of the associated procedural elements. The By-law also governsa number of other aspects, Recommendation(s):It is recommendedthatthe Board approve the proposed revised Procedural By-Law.Financial Implications:There are no financial implications arising from the recommendation(s) contained in this report. \f2such as the duties of the Chair and Vice Chair, Board meeting agendas and minutes, and Committees of the Board.In 2020, the Procedural By-law was updated to includemodifications to the Board’s meeting procedures –including with respect to holding electronic meetings –as well as other Board practices, and the changing role of the Board’s Executive Director.  Board Office Staff, in consultation with counsel from City Legal, drafted a number of amendments to incorporate these changes.These updates were approved by the Board at its meeting onJune 19, 2020 (Min. No. P90/20 refers).At the Board’s April 30, 2024 meeting, the Board received notice of proposed revisions to the By-law, in accordance with section 26.2 of the By-law.Proposed Revisions to the Procedural By-lawOn April 1, 2024, the new Community Safety and Policing Act(the Act) came into force, replacingthe Police Services Actas the primary statutory framework governing policing in Ontario.This has resulted in a number of required changes to the Procedural By-law, in order to bring it into complianceand alignmentwith the Act. In addition, a number of changes are being proposed to improve the handling of Board meetings, to make them more efficient and effective.These proposed revisions have been developed in consultation with Board Members.Substantive proposed revisions to the By-law falling under this category include the following:∑Section 3.1(r) was amended to include advisory panels as one of the bodies to which a matter might be referred for consideration.∑Section 8.1 was amendedto better align the By-law with current and best practices, including: oproviding the Chief of Police with the opportunity to make a verbal update to the Board;oremoving the provision for a consent agenda: all matters before the Board are to be considered equally;olistingitems deemed confidential;in accordance with the Act, only the general nature of such items will be disclosed.∑Section 11.3A was added to provide that written consent must be sought from all Board Members who are unable to attend a rescheduled regular meeting. ∑Section 11.4 was amendedto clarify and simplify provisions around the calling of a meeting when the Chair and/or Vice Chair are not present.∑Section 17.3 was amended to include an option for the Chair to determine that an agenda item requested by a member of the public falls under an existing agenda \f3item scheduled for the next regular meeting, and list the requested deputation under that item.∑In accordance with the Act, the Board discloses the general nature of confidential matters that are to be discussed in camera.Section 17.3A was added to clarify that deputations will not be heard on items listed on the confidential agenda.∑To establish a clear process for the submission of Motions by Board Members,Section 21.4 was amended and sections 21.4A-C were added. The process will ensure that Board Office Staff have sufficient time to prepare motions for consideration by the Board, and that Board Members have sufficient time to review proposed motions before discussing them at the meeting. The process also includes a provision to allow the Chair to rule a motion invalid if it is unrelated to the matter under consideration, with the Board having the final decision in case such a determination is appealed.Please note that the language of section 21.4A and 21.4B has been revised from the language provided at the Notice of Proposed Revisions, to better align it with a similar provision in the City’s Council Procedures and ensure greater clarity.∑Section 21.6 was amended to remove the provision that, during a Recorded Vote, a Board Member’s failure to vote will be deemed anegative vote.Additional changes include ensuring consistent language across the By-law, use of gender-neutral language where appropriate, and other housekeeping changes to improve clarity and readability.The proposed revised By-law is included as Appendix A.Conclusion:The proposed revised Procedural By-law will align the By-law withthe Act, improve its clarity, and improve the processes necessary to ensure Board Meetings are efficient and effective.It is recommended that the Board approved the proposed revised Procedural By-law.Respectfully submitted,Dubi

3.The Board direct the Executive Director, in consultation with Committee Members and the Chief’s Office, to explore a flexible Budget Committee meeting schedule that may allow for meetings \f2to take place at different times, locations,and/or through a virtual platform, and provide notice to the public as early as possible;and4.The Board forward a copy of this report to the City Manager, and to the Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer (CFO).Financial Implications:There are no financial implications arising from the recommendation(s) contained in this report.Summary:The purpose of this report is to strike the 2025 Budget Committee that will assist in the development of theToronto Police Service’s 2025capital, operating, and Parking Enforcement Unit’s budget requests as well as the Board’s 2025 operating budget request.Discussion:BackgroundRelevant Board Policies and ComplianceThis report is inalignment andcompliance with the Board’s Budget Transparency Policy.Committee Membership and Meeting InformationIt is proposed that the Budget Committee will be chaired by the Board’s Chair Ann Morgan, andtwo additional members to be selected by the Boardwill serve as members. All Board Members are encouraged and welcome to attend and participate in the Budget Committee’s meetings, however,only Committee Members will be able to vote.The Budget Committee’s meetings will be convened in public, in accordance with the Board’s Procedural Bylaw. As with all public Board meetings, members of the public will have an opportunity to participate through our established deputation process.The Board will ensure that there will be other opportunities for public input into the budget process, with exact details to be determined.DatesOver the past year, the Board has received feedback from members of the publicregarding the budget process and increasing the ways that it can be more transparent and accessible. In order to enhance public engagement, it is recommended that the Executive Director be directed, in consultation with Committee Members and the Chief’s Office, to explore a flexible Budget Committee meeting schedule that may allow for meetingsto take place at different times, locations,and/or through a virtual platform. \f3Finalized dates, times, and locationswill be publicly communicated through the Board’s website and social media channel as appropriate.Equity Analysis Ensuring that the 2025 budget process embraces transparency will increase accessibility for Torontonians, who will be able to participate and engage more deeply and be better educated on the budget development process. They will also have other opportunities to be heard throughout the process.Conclusion:It is therefore recommended that:1.The Toronto Police Services Board (Board) amend the Committees Bylaw by adding section 3A as follows: 3A Budget Committee3A.1  The Board establishes a committee named Budget Committee, for the purpose of reviewing the Toronto Police Service’s capital, operating, and the Parking Enforcement Unit’s budget requests as well as the Board’s operating budget request, and make recommendations to the Board;3A.2  The Budget Committee shall be composed of at least three Board Members, to be appointed by resolution for a term of one year.  3A.3   The quorum for a meeting of the Budget Committee is two committee members.2.The Board designate Chair Ann Morgan, and two additional members to be selected by the Boardas members of the Budget Committee; 3.The Board direct the Executive Director, in consultation with Committee Members and the Chief’s Office, to explore a flexible Budget Committee meeting schedule that may allow for meetings to take place at different times, locations, and/or through a virtual platform, and provide notice to the public as early as possible; and4.The Board forward a copy of this report to the City Manager, and to the Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\f4Respectfully submitted,Dubi KanengisserExecutive DirectorContactDanielle DowdySenior Advisor, Strategic Policy and Stakeholder RelationsEmail: Danielle.Dowdy@tpsb.ca\fToronto Police Service Board40 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2J3|Phone: 416-808-8080   Fax: 416-808-8082 |www.tpsb.caPUBLIC REPORTMay 21, 2024To:Chair and MembersToronto Police Service BoardFrom:Myron DemkiwChief of PoliceSubject:2024 Operating Budget Variance for the Toronto Police Service, Period Ending March 31, 2024Purpose:☒Information Purposes Only☐Seeking DecisionSummary:The purpose of this report is to provide the Board with the Service’s 2024 projected year-end variance as at March 31, 2024.  The Service’s projected total net expenditures are $1,194.5M, resulting in a projected $20.6M unfavourable 2024 year-end variance.Table 1 provides a high-level summary of variances and explanations by feature category.  Year to date and projection figures are shown in the Appendix1at the end of this report. Recommendation:This report recommends thatthe Toronto Police Services Board (Board) forward a copy of this report to the City of Toronto (City) Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer for information and inclusion in the variance reporting to the City’s Budget Committee.Financial Implications:The Toronto Police Service’s (Service) 2024 approved net operating budget is $1,173.9Million (M).  As at March 31, 2024, the Service is projecting a$20.6Munfavourable variance.The Service will pursue opportunities for expenditure reduction and/or increasing revenue throughout the year in order to mitigate year-end deficits to the extent possible.  Table 1provides a breakdown of the projected variance, by feature category. \f2Table 1 –2024 Variance by Feature Category($Ms)Category2024 Budget2024 ProjectionVariance Fav (UnFav)ExplanationSalaries$896.3$891.4$4.9∑In 2023, uniform separations were 192, surpassing the 175 assumed during the2024 budget process.  Currently, uniform separations are projected to be 180 vs budget of 160for 2024, resulting in a projected favourable variance.∑The cadet hiring plan of four classes of 90 remains on target. Although lateral hires are currently eightahead of target, the projected year end strength is still currently projected to be 31 fewer officers by year end than budgeted (projection of 5,402officerscompared to the budget of 5,433officers).Premium Pay$58.9$94.3($35.4)∑Discussed below.Benefits$277.4$277.4$0.0∑The Service is experiencing pressures in medical / dental and Workplace Safety and Insurance Board costs. However, at this time, a zero variance is projected, as these expenditures have historically fluctuated during the year.Non Salary$110.1$111.9($1.8)∑Unfavourable variancesare projected in training and equipment accounts. However, these expenses are funded by outside agencies, resulting in a net zero variance to the Service.\f3Category2024 Budget2024 ProjectionVariance Fav (UnFav)ExplanationContributions to / (Drawsfrom) Reserves($47.9)($47.9)$0.0∑Contributionto and/or draws from the following reservesare made: City Sick Pay Gratuity; Vehicle and Equipment; Modernization; Central Sick; Post-Retirement Health; and Legal. ∑Additionally, withdrawals will be made from the City’s Special Event Reserve and the City’s Budget Bridging & Balancing Reserves. ∑At this time, no variance is anticipated.Revenue($120.9)(124.2)$3.3∑Projectedincreased recoveries of $1.8M for non-salary purchases, as noted in the non-salary section, and $3.3M for premium payrecoveries (e.g. Traffic direction pilot and provincial initiatives).  Therefore, partially mitigating some of the spending pressures listed above.∑Projected short fall in recoveries for the provincial uploading of courtsis $3.4M due tolower than anticipated recoverable cost.  ∑Favourable variance of $1.6M is projected in fees (e.g. paid duty administration, vulnerable sector screening).Net Impact of Grants$0.0($2.4)$2.4∑Grant funding generally results in a net zerovariance, as funds are provided for expenditures to achieve specific purposes.  However, a net favourable variance is projected in this category since a number of permanent, funded positions are assigned to provincially supported programs,covered by the grant, through an allocation of internal resources at no incremental costs to the Service.  .  Total Preliminary Net$1,173.9$1,200.5($26.6)Expenditure Reductions($6.0)$6.0∑Discussed below.\f4Category2024 Budget2024 ProjectionVariance Fav (UnFav)ExplanationTotal Net$1,173.9$1,194.5($20.6)Discussion:BackgroundAt its December 19, 2023 meeting, the Board approved the Service’s budget request at $1,186.5M Net and $1,361.5M Gross (Min. No. P2023-1219-2.2 refers).Subsequently, City Council, at its February 14, 2024 meeting, approved the Service’s 2024 operating budget at $1,173.9M Net, a reduction of $12.6M from the Board approved budget.  The net budget reduction was achieved by a Council approved allocation of funding from the Budget Bridging & Balancing Reserve and will result in the same available funding as the Board approved budget.Although this results in the same available funding, the bridging actionsof $12.6M are not considered permanent funding and will result in budget pressures in future years. As at March 31, 2024, the Service is projecting a year-end unfavourable variance of $20.6M.  In response, the Service is committed to implementing proactiveand strategic measures to mitigate the projected shortfall. Further details and a comprehensive update will be provided to the Board as part of the 2nd quarter variance reporting. Relevant Board Policies and ComplianceThis report is in compliance with the Board’s Budget Transparency Policy, approved on July 29, 2021 (Min. No. P2021-0729-3.0. refers).Pressures and Opportunities:The most significant pressure on the budget is premium pay.  The total premium pay budget is $58.9M with a projected spending of $94.3M resulting in an unfavourable variance of $35.4M in this category.There is a base level of uniform premium pay inherent to policing.   Premium pay is incurred for: ∑extended tours of duty (e.g., when officers are involved in an arrest at the time their shift ends);∑court attendance scheduled for when the officer is off-duty; and ∑call-backs (e.g., when an officer is required to work additional shifts to ensure appropriate staffing levels are maintained or for specific initiatives). The 2024 operating budget includes an opening net premium pay pressure of approximately $22.5M, as the Service experienced an unfavourable premium pay \f5variance of $30.5M in 2023 or a net $22.5M variance when adjusted for onetime events (e.g. TTC safety initiative and Project Resolute) and revenue initiatives (e.g. Traffic Direction Pilot).  Although the approved operating budget includes a $10.0M draw from the City’s Special Events Fund, the 2024 operating budget submission included a zeroincrease to the premium pay budget in order to keep the Service’s budget increase to a minimum.The Service’s ability to deal with and absorb the impact of major unplanned events (e.g., demonstrations, emergency events, and homicide / missing persons) relies on the use of off-duty officers which results in premium pay costs.  The redeployment of the Community Response Units to the Neighbourhood Community Officer Program during 2022 has reduced the capacity for the Service to respond to unplanned events with on duty resources.  As a result, the Service has had to rely on off duty resources by way of call-backs in order to provide the surge capacity required in order to ensure adequate resources are available to respond during major events and public safety issues.  For instance, year to date premium pay costs for Project Resolute are $2.3M.  If this spending trendcontinues, projected spending will reach $9.2Mby year end.  It must be noted that in order to maintain safety and security for all involved, the Service is allocating significant on duty resources as wellwhich could be resulting in additional premium pay costs for impacted units.Although the Service will seek to have less reliance on premium pay as staffing levels ramp up, the Service is still experiencing pressures staffingmajor special events,and to adequately resourcepublic safety initiatives.  While hiring additional officers has the potential to reduce overtime costs through improved efficiency and workload distribution, its impactis being offset due to growth in demand.  In addition, the expenditure on court attendance while off duty,has returnedtopre-pandemiclevels.  As a result, premium pay is projected to be overspent by $35.4M, of which $3.3M is projected as being funded from outside agencies, $10.0Mfunded from special events reserve and $9.2Mresulting from project Resolute. As Table 1 refers, the preliminary year-end projections are trending $26.6M unfavourable, or $20.6M after expenditure reductions. It must be noted that projections are based on estimatesand the Service is actively striving to comewithin its approved budget. Currently, the Service is exploring various actions and mitigations which include the following:∑ongoing review of the timing and pace of hiring and associated impacts to the Service’s workforce;∑examining the use, nature and time dedicated to premium pay with the objective of curbing this cost to keep expenditures to an absolute minimum.∑a reassessment of non-salary expendituresand deferral or reallocation of budgets where possible and sustainable;\f6∑a re-evaluation of liabilities and bringing into income where justifiedand in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (G.A.A.P.);∑maximizing grant funding opportunitiesand seeking cost recovery opportunities; and∑subject to protecting future funding viability, reassessing contribution strategies with a view to defer reserve contributions where warrantedand prudent.Base on the above actions, the Servicehas identifiednet expenditure reductions of $6.0Mto datethat will reduce the budget pressure. In addition to identifying cost avoidance measures, the Service also needs to manage budget pressures associated with growing demand, impacts of Project Resolute and other unanticipated costs.  The new Community Safety and Policing Act (C.S.P.A.), which replaces the Police Services Acteffective April 1st2024, has mandated new equipment and training standards.  The Service is currently assessing the financial implications of these new standardsand strategies to address them. Once the projected impact isdetermined, the Service will explore funding sources with the City and the Province to meet the requirements under the regulations and future variance reports will be adjusted to reflect the estimated spending requirements.Conclusion:As at March 31, 2024, the Service is projecting to be $20.6M overspent.  The Service is/will pursue opportunities for expenditure reduction and/or increasing revenue throughout the year in order to mitigate year-end deficits to the extent possible.

Subsequently, City Council, at its February 14, 2024 meeting, approved the Service’s 2024-2033 capital program at the same level as the Boardapproved amount. Attachment A provides the approved 2024-2033 capital program (Min. No. P2023-1219-2.3 refers).In addition to the approved program, available funds have been carried forward from previous years to 2024, in keeping with City financing rules.The total amount of carry forwards into 2024 is $20.1M.As capital projects progress, new information regularly emerges regarding the timing and amount of funding required.  For instance, delays might postpone funding requirements to future years, while othercircumstancesmay necessitate bringing forward funds into 2024. The recommendations outlined in this report identifyprojects requiring additional or expedited funding in 2024. Moreover, they propose the source of fundingwithout compromising the financial needs of other projects in 2024. This strategic reallocation ensures that current requirements, such as emerging challenges or escalating costs, are promptly addressed, while preventing funds from being underutilizedin delayed projects.It should be noted that \f3Summary:The purpose of this report is to provide the Board with the status of the Service’s capital projects as atMarch 31, 2024.It also includes recommendations for in-year funding adjustments.Attachment Aprovides a detailed list of the 2024-2033Capital program.As of March 31, 2024 all projects are on time and budget. repurposing funds from other projects, has no financial impact on the netcapital program.Specific details about the recommended funding changes are provided in the report.Table 1 provides a summary of the approvedcapital funding in 2024and projected expenditures. It also includes carry forward funding from previous yearsand is inclusive of the adjustmentsrecommendedin this report. From the adjusted gross funding of $113.3M in 2024, $107.8M is projected to be utilized. The 2024 estimated gross spending rate is 95.2%. The estimated under-expenditure of $5.5M,will be carried forward to 2025.Table 1 –Summary of 2024 Budget and Expenditures (M’s)\f4Discussion:BackgroundThe Service’s primary goal is to ensure capital projects are completed on budget and on schedule. This includes the need to ensure any required changes are identified as quickly and transparently as possible. The 2024 capital programis updated with the latest assumptions on scope, schedule and resourcing and aligns with the Service’s objectives. Capitalprojects fall under the following four main categories:∑Facility projects;∑Information Technology modernization projects;∑Replacements, maintenance,and equipment projects; and∑Lifecycle projects.Relevant Board Policies and ComplianceThis report is in compliance with the Board’s Budget Transparency Policy, approved on July 29, 2021 (Min. No. P2021-0729-3.0. refers).Capital Program VariancesTable 2 provides a high-level summary of 2024projects, reflecting the recommendations in this report, and variances as of March 31, 2024.Additional detail is provided below for projects as noted in the table.For additional information on these projects please refer to the approved 2024-2033 Capital Program (Min. No. P2023-1219-2.3 refers).\f5Table 2 –2024 Capital Budget Variance Report as ofMarch 31, 2024($000s)\f6Long Term Facility Plan -41 Division; New BuildThis project provides funding for a new 41 Division facility. The phased construction and demolition approach for a new building on the existing 41 Division site will provide the Service with a new facility at the corner of Birchmount and Eglinton Avenues,an optimal, easily accessible site with ample area for future expansion. The new division will provide a modern, efficient workspace for the Service, serving the community for decades to come. The new 41 Division will be the first Net Zero Emission building in the Service’s asset base and the first of its kind in Ontario. During the construction, personnel will continue to occupy a portion of the existing building as well as neighbouring Divisions, as required, to allow for uninterrupted business operations. The City’s Net Zero Emissions requirement caused project delaysin 2023for building redesign and subsequent tendering of the various bid packages.To mitigate the overallschedule impact and achieve critical milestone dates, the construction schedulehas been expedited in some work areas.Therefore, acceleration of funding from year 2025 to 2024 is required. The overall project cost remains the same; however, the distribution of funding over the current and future years must be adjusted to keep pace with construction progression to meet Phase 1 occupancy in 2024.To sustain the current construction timeline, an additional $3.025Mwill be necessary in 2024. This can be facilitated by reallocating $170Kfrom the Mobile Command Centre, which is projectedto finish under budgetin 2024, and expediting $2.86M of fundingfrom 2025 to 2024.Information Technology Storage Growth projectThis project is a critical initiative designed to comprehensively track and quantify the substantial and continuous escalation in the Service’s data storage demands. The demand for data is growing exponentiallydue to pressing police operational needs suchas evidence collection, disclosure, analytics, transparency, accountability, and statutory obligations.In 2024, the Service hasencounteredunforeseen financial pressures associated with the rapid growth of data storage. This expansion has surpassed forecasts due to several emerging factors:∑There have been logistical and operational delays in migrating data from legacy locations tothe Service’s cloud-based solutionEvidence.com;∑Renovationdelays at the data center have significantly disrupted the life cycle replacement of existing storage systems. Typically, each modernization cycle yields additional storage capacity through technological advancements, but these gains have been hindered, and anticipated increases in storage capacity in existing equipment havenot yet been realized; and∑Data storage usage continues to exceed projections, particularly in major crime areas, due to the larger volumes and increased complexity of evidence collected duringinvestigations.\f7Ongoing discussions and strategies areunderway regarding data classification and retention policies to manage data diversity, eliminate redundancyand reduce overall storage requirements. However, until these measures are implemented, duplicate and redundant data retention will persist.To address thisneed, a transfer of $1.506M in additional funding can be accommodated through a transfer of $1M from the 2024 cash flow of the State-of-Good-Repair project which experienced some delays,and $506K from the Long-Term Facility Plan -Facility and Process Improvement project, as it is projected to conclude below budgetin 2024.Mobile Workstation Lifecycle ReplacementThe mobile workstation lifecycle project manages the acquisition, deployment, maintenance, refresh, and disposal of Service mobileworkstationcomputer equipmentmounted in police vehicles. Thisproject ensures the hardware maintains optimal performance, security, and usability, while minimizing costs and risks.Initially, the lifecycle replacement plan was to begin in 2025. However,the Service’scurrent hardware is unable to support Windows 11, which becomes necessary as Windows 10 reaches end of life in October 2025. To ensure continued supportability and security, devices must be replaced to run Windows 11 before this deadline.The 2024 budget did not anticipate this requirement as the original plan assumed that police vehicles would need to be brought to a Service’s facility for workstation replacement, causing significant effort, coordination, and downtime for the vehicles this year. However, a new method isbeingimplemented that enables the replacement ofmobile workstations without taking vehicles out of service. This reduces the time and complexity of the migration process and minimizes disruption to the Service. As a result of this more efficient rollout process,Information Technology Services (I.T.S.)can commence the rollout earlier than initially planned. This ensures that the migration to Windows 11 for mobile workstations will be completed well ahead of the Windows 10 end-of-life deadline.The Windows 11 rollout is a significant project,spanning over a year to complete for all Service Windows endpoints. Starting the lifecycle replacements for mobile workstations in 2024 is crucial to meet the Windows 10 end of life deadline. This early start ensures that I.T.S.staff have sufficient time to migrate Service Windows endpoints to Windows 11, thereby avoiding potential delays if migration activities were to start in 2025.To address this request, a transfer of $1.46M in additional funding can be accommodated through a transfer from the Workstation, Laptop, Printer Lifecycle project. As the Service consolidated devices and transitioned tolaptops during the pandemic, fewerworkstations requiredlifecyclereplacement, resulting insavingsthat can be reallocated.\f8Infrastructure Lifecycle ReplacementThis project integrates a comprehensive Lifecycle program encompassing storage, server, network, and business continuity initiatives. This consolidation enhances deployment efficiency and cost savings by aligning budget requests with industry device standards and strategically modernizing the Service’s data infrastructure. The Service’s adoption of cloud environments has reshaped the required data infrastructure for policing operations. The Service's dual datacentres will transition to flexible, robust cloud-enabled designs. These upgrades facilitate the digital transformation of policing services, enabling mobile officers to access systems and applications quickly and affordably, wherever and whenever needed. The I.T. Infrastructure Lifecycle Replacementprogram faces cost pressures in 2024 that need to be addressed, notably:∑The cloud-based modernization of the datacentres is a large and multiyear transition inInformation Technology (I.T.)strategy.In 2024, the technology required for cloud adoptionis in high demand, and coupled with inflationary impacts, the cost of cloud technology is rising. ∑In order to minimizecapital asks and transition tonew technology with existing resources, the Service has extended the life of its servers.  Extending the server lifespan however is now creating operational risks that now necessitate lifecycle replacement.   In order to address the above challenges, funds can be freed up with existing projects in the 2024 capital program that will be completed under budget. Additionally, there is a planned draw of $2.3M from the Vehicle and Equipment reservefor this project. Therefore funding of $3.27M is being requested from the following transfers;∑$327K from the 2024 cash flow of the Connected Officer Lifecycle replacement project;∑$256.9K from the 2024 cash flow of the Automatic Vehicle Locator (A.V.L.) project;∑$385.3K from the 2024 cash flow of the In-Car Camera project.∑$2.3M from the Vehicle and Equipment reserveas planned for in the 2024 budget process.There is no net impact on the 2024-2033 capital program as a result of these transfers.Conclusion:The Service’s primary goal is to ensure capital projects are completed on budget and on schedule. This includes the need to ensure any required changes are identified as quickly and transparently as possible. This report is updating the 2024 funding requirement for select projects within the overall Capital Program.  As of March 31, 2024, most projects remain on track.\f9From the Service’s adjusted gross funding of $113.3M in 2024, $107.8M is projected to be utilized. The 2024 estimated gross spending rate is 95.2%. The entire under-expenditure of $5.5M,will be carried forward to 2025.The Board will continue to be kept apprised of project progress through the quarterly variance report, including any major issues as projects progress, and any proposed capital program changes.Ms. Svina Dhaliwal, Chief Administrative Officerand Mr. Colin Stairs, Chief Information Officer, will be in attendance to answer any questions the Board may have regarding this report.Respectfully submitted,Myron Demkiw, M.O.M.Chief of PoliceAttachments:Attachment A -2024-2033 Capital program\f10\fToronto Police Service Board40 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2J3|Phone: 416-808-8080   Fax: 416-808-8082 |www.tpsb.caPUBLIC REPORTMay 22, 2024To:Chair and MembersToronto Police Service BoardFrom:Myron DemkiwChief of PoliceSubject:2024 Operating Budget Variance for the Toronto Police Service Parking Enforcement Unit, Period Ending March 31, 2024Purpose:☒Information Purposes Only☐Seeking DecisionSummary:The purpose of this report is to provide the Board with information on the P.E.U.’s 2024projected year-end variance as at March 31, 2024.

As a result, there is an unanticipated cost of approximately $0.2M to replace the P.E.U.’s entire stock of parking tags to reflect the new amounts.\f3Category2024 Budget ($Ms)2024 ProjectionVariance Fav (UnFav)ExplanationServices$6.2$6.2$0.0∑Significant items in this category include interdepartmental chargebacks, contributions to reserves, rental of property and maintenance, and support costs for the handheld parking devices.  ∑No variance is anticipated at this time.Revenue (e.g. T.T.C., towing recoveries)($1.5)$1.7$0.2∑Revenues include towing recoveries, draws from reserves, and recoveries from the Toronto Transit Commission (T.T.C.).  The T.T.C. recoveries are for premium pay expenditures that are incurred to enforce parking by-laws on T.T.C. right of ways, necessitated by the ongoing weekend subway closures for signal replacements maintenance.∑Additionally, an anticipated additional revenue of $0.2M from the City’s Traffic Direction Pilot Program is expected to offset program costs.Total Net$51.3$51.3$0.0Discussion:BackgroundAt its December 19, 2023 meeting, the Board approved the Toronto Police Service’s Parking Enforcement Unit (P.E.U.) operating budget request at $51.3 Million (M) (Min. No. P2023-1219-2.4 refers), a 0% increase over the 2023 approved budget.  Subsequently, City Council, at its February 14, 2024 meeting, approved the P.E.U.’s 2024operating budget at the same amount.The P.E.U. is managed by the Service; however, the P.E.U.’s operating budget is separate from the Toronto Police Service (Service) budget, and is maintained in the City’s non-program budget.  In addition, revenues from the collection of parking tags issued accrue to the City, not the Service.Relevant Board Policies and ComplianceThis report is in compliance with the Board’s Budget Transparency Policy, approved on July 29, 2021 (Min. No. P2021-0729-3.0. refers).\f4Pressures and OpportunitiesThe P.E.U.’s budget pressures stem from non-salary costs. There is anunanticipated cost of $0.2M to replace the P.E.U.’s entire stock of parking tags due to the newly adopted changes to Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 610. In addition, the Service and the P.E.U. are in the planning stages of additional Traffic and Modernization projects set to begin later in 2024 (such as automated licence plate recognition, vehicle impound management, e-ticketing software/hardware, and other technology that will modernize operations and create efficiencies). Funding for these projects has not yet been identified within the 2024 budget process.  Offsetting the budget pressures,are projected increases to revenues from the City’s Traffic Direction Pilot Program. The program’s initial term was for six months during 2023, and its extension was still being considered during the 2024 budget process, therefore the cost recoveries from this program were not budgeted for.The hiring of Special Constables and Cadetsby the Servicehas a significant impact on the P.E.U., given the historical trend of someP.E.O.s transitioning to those roles. While predicting the number of P.E.O.s transitioning to these positions is challenging,the Servicecontinuesto monitor actual separations throughout the year and adjuststhe P.E.O. hiring plan accordingly.As P.EO. separations continue due to retirements or promotions to other positions, new P.E.O.s are hired at the lowest ‘step’ in the salary band, resulting in cost savings.Conclusion:As at March 31, 2024, the P.E.U. is not projecting any year-end variance.

Rather, the projection of expenditures to year-end is done through an analysis of all accounts, taking into consideration factors such as expenditures to date, future commitments and spending patterns.Salaries & BenefitsYear-to-date expenditures for Salaries and Benefits are lower than budgeted, as not all Board staff are at the highest ‘step’ of their respective salary band, and there are currently three vacant positions. It is anticipated that these positions will be filled in the second and third quarters of the year, thereforea favourable variance of $361,700is expected at year-end. These projected savings are expected to be fully offset by lower than budgeted draws from reserves.Non-Salary Expenditures/Draws from ReservesThe majority of the costs in this category are for arbitrations/grievances and City charge backs for legal services.The Toronto Police ServiceBoard cannot predict or control the number of grievances filed or referred to arbitration, as filings are at the discretion of bargaining units.  In order to address this uncertainty and ensure adequate financial resources are available to \f3respond to these matters when they arise, the 2024Operating Budget includes a $424,800 contribution to a Reserve for costs associated with the provision of legal advice and representation.  Fluctuations in legal spending will be dealt with by increasing or decreasing the budgeted reserve contribution in future years’ operating budgets so that the Board ultimately has funds available in the Reserve, upon which to draw, to fund these variable expenditures.  In case of a favourable operating variance at year-end, the Board may choose to draw less than the budgeted amount from the reserves in order to preserve the reserves’ balances.Conclusion:As of March 31, 2024, no variance is being projected by the end of 2024.  Favourable variances in salaries& benefits will be offset by reducing draws from reserves, which will help maintain reserve balances.Respectfully submitted,Dubi KanengisserExecutive Director and Chief of Staff\fToronto Police Service Board40 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2J3|Phone: 416-808-8080   Fax: 416-808-8082 |www.tpsb.caPUBLIC REPORTMay 7, 2024To:Chair and MembersToronto Police Service BoardFrom:Myron DemkiwChief of PoliceSubject:Chief Administrative Investigation into the AllegedSexual Assault of Complainant 2023.52Purpose:☒Information Purposes Only☐Seeking DecisionSummary:The Professional Standards –S.I.U.

Incident Narrative“The evidence collected by the SIU, including video footage that partly captured the events in question, gives rise to the following scenario. As was his legal right, the SO chose not to interview with the SIU or authorize the release of his notes.In the afternoon of October 11, 2023, the SO was riding his marked police motorcycle on Evans Avenue when an e-bike came to his attention and he decided to follow it. The e-bike was being operated by a male not wearing a helmet –a traffic offence.Thee-bike operator was the Complainant. Aware he was being followed by the SO, the Complainant accelerated to get away. He turned from westbound Evans Avenue onto southbound Horner Avenue where he engaged in reckless driving –he jumped the west sidecurb, travelled at speed on the west sidewalk and adjacent grass approaching Judson Street, and veered into a left-hand turn onto Judson Street from the west sidewalk.The SO pursued the Complainant down Horner Avenue with his emergency lights activated,eventually pulling alongside him in the curb lane as the e-bike travelled off road. When the Complainant turned left behind him onto Judson Street, the officer executed a U-turn and then turned right to continue the chase. By this time, the Complainant was well ahead of the SO.Once on Judson Street, the SO accelerated eastward to close the gap with the e-bike. The officer reached a top speed of about 137 km/h about 200 meters from Islington Avenue, approximately 400 meterseast of Judson Street, afterwhich he started to \f3decelerate. The SO arrived at the Islington Avenue intersection –the site of a motor vehicle collision –seconds later.The Complainant had entered the Islington Avenue intersection on a red light and was struck by a southbound vehicle. The impact tossed him from the e-bike and into the northbound lanes.The SO approached the Complainant to render aid.He radioed a request for an ambulance to the area. The time was about 1:47 p.m.The Complainant was transported to hospital and diagnosed with fractures of the left leg, left ankle and spine.”Analysis and Director’s Decision“The Complainant was seriously injured in a motor vehicle collisionin Toronto on October 11, 2023. As the vehicle he was operating was being pursued by a TPS motorcycle at the time, the SIU was notified of the incident and initiated an investigation.The SO was identified as the subject official. The investigation is now concluded. On my assessment of the evidence, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the SO committed a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s injuries.The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harmand criminal negligence causing bodily harm contrary to sections 320.13(2) and 221 of the Criminal Code. The former is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances. The latter is premised on even more egregious conduct thatdemonstrates a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.It is not made out unless the neglect constitutes a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable standard of care.In the instant case, the question is whether there was any want of care on the part of the SO, sufficiently serious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision. In my view, there was not.The SO had cause to initiate a pursuit of the Complainant. He had seen him operating an e-bike without a helmet –an offence under the Highway Traffic Act. And there is no indication that he had identified the Complainant or the e-bike before the collision, either of which would have called for a termination of the pursuit under the terms of O. Reg. 266/10 –the regulation governing pursuits in the province.With respect to the manner in which the SO comported himself throughout his engagement with the Complainant, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officer transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law. There are aspects of the SO’s conduct that are subject to legitimate scrutiny.Pursuant to TPS policy, the officer ought not tohave pursued the e-bike.He was operating a motorcycle and the person he was chasing was also on a motorized bicycle –each a disqualifying factor. The SO also travelled at dangerously high speeds on Judson Street, topping out at 137 km/h. \f4Lastly, the officer had observed enough of the Complainant’s dangerous driving to realize that his continued pursuit was not in the interests of public safety and, yet, he persisted. On the other side of the ledger, traffic along the pursuit route was light to moderate with very little pedestrian traffic and the area was mostly commercial and industrial in nature; that is to say, the dangers inherent in the SO’s speeds were not aggravated by environmental factors. The fact that the officer had his emergency lights activated for most of the pursuit, allowing third-party traffic notice of his presence, is another mitigating factor. Lastly, the evidence indicates that the SO, in the penultimate stages of the pursuit on Judson Street, was well behind the e-bike and no less than about 100 metres back as the Complainant entered the Islington Avenue intersection.In the circumstances, it would not be fair to say that the SO effectively pushed the Complainant into the intersection.As an eyewitness told the SIU, the Complainant could have turned right on Islington Avenue to continue his flight from police instead of continuing straight ahead.On the aforementioned-record, when the SO’s indiscretions are weighed in the balance with the extenuating considerations, I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that his conduct departed markedly from a reasonable standard of care.As such, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against the officer.”Summary of the Toronto Police Service’s InvestigationThe P.R.S. –S.I.U. Liaisonand Traffic Services (T.S.V.)conducted an administrative investigation mandated by provincial legislation.This investigation examined the circumstances of thevehicle injury in relation to the applicable legislation, policing services provided, procedures, and the conduct of the involved officer.The S.I.U.

Incident Narrative“The evidence collected by the SIU, includinginterviews with police officers who dealt with the Complainant at times during his period of custody, and video footage that captured the incident in parts, gives rise to the following scenario.In the afternoonof November1, 2023,the Complainant was arrested by WO #12 and WO #10 inside the Tim Hortons located at 26 Dundas Street East, Toronto. The officers had been alerted to his presence inside the shop by the CW, who explained that the Complainant had threatened him the day before with a metal rod. The Complainant refused to surrender willingly to arrest but was taken into custody without much issue after he was grounded by the officers.WO#8 and WO #9 arrived on scene to transport the Complainant to 51 Division. The Complainant was placed in the rear seat where he started banging his head against a window. Enroute to the station, he repeatedly struck his head off the window and partition separating the front and rear compartments of the vehicle, eventually inflicting a cut to his forehead.Arriving at the station, the officers called for paramedics to examine the Complainant given the laceration. They attended, examined the Complainant, and cleared him of any serious injury. The Complainant was brought into the station, booked and placed in an interview room with padding.Inside the interview room, the Complainant struck himself twice to the right side of the head, after which he started to tear the padding from the wall.That action released \f3particles into the air that set off a fire alarm. Officers attended at the interview room and, seeing the damage to the walls, decided to remove the Complainant.The Complainant did not go willingly.  He struggled against the officers as they forcibly removed him from the room and placed him inside another interview room before handcuffing him to the back. The Complainant was subsequently lodged in a cell but not for long. Concerned that he was in possession of screws from the padding he had damaged, the staff sergeant at the station authorized a strip search.Officers removed the Complainant from the cell and escorted him to the search room where he again struggled while the strip search was being performed. The screws were not located and the Complainant was returned to his cell.Just before midnight, the Complainant complained of pain.He was transported by ambulance to hospital and diagnosed with a broken nose and fractured left orbital bone.”S.I.U. Analysis and Director’s Decision“The Complainant was seriously injured while in the custody of the TPS on November 1, 2023.The SIU was notified of the incident and initiated an investigation.The investigation is now concluded.On my assessment of the evidence, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any TPS officer committed a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s injuries.Pursuant to section 25(1) of the Criminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.I am satisfied that theComplainant was lawfully in custody from the moment of his arrest on November 1, 2023, until his release in the afternoon of the following day. Having spoken to the victim of a reported assault at the hands of the Complainant the day before, WO #10 and WO #12 were within their rights in effecting his arrest for assault.I amfurther satisfied that the Complainant was treated lawfully by his custodians at all times. The takedown at the Tim Hortons appears to have been in order. The officers had reason to believe that the Complainant might be armed with a weapon and would reasonably have wanted to minimize the risk of a weapon being brought into play at the first sign of resistance by the Complainant, which is what occurred. Thereafter, officers exercised a reasonable standard of care over the Complainant’s health and well-being, as was demonstrated by WO #9 and WO #8 when they arranged for paramedics to examine the Complainant prior to being booked at 51 Division. When the Complainant complained of pain late in the day on November 2, 2023, he was transported to hospital for medical attention. The strip search that occurred of his person would also appear to have been justified. The Complainant had just damaged an interview room and there \f4was genuine concern that he had secreted on his person some screws that seemed to be missing from the wall. As the Complainant had been acting in a disorderly manner and expressed suicidal ideations en route to the division, there were reasonable and probable grounds to believe that a strip search was necessary in the interests of his safety and the safety of the officers. It is clear that some force was brought to bear against the Complainant by his custodians but, aside from several strikes delivered by WO #1 and WO #11, this consisted of the officers attempting to wrestle control of a resistant prisoner and would not appear responsible for the injuries in question. Nor would it appear that the strikes, delivered to the Complainant’s midsection during the strip search, caused the injuries or were excessive in light of the physical challenge the officers were facing. In fact, the evidence suggests that the Complainant’s facial fractures were self-inflictedand very likely the result of his purposefully striking his head, whether against a rear window or partition in the police cruiser on the way to the division or the floor while being strip searched.For the foregoing reasons, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal chargesin this case. The file is closed”.Summary of the Toronto Police Service’s InvestigationThe P.R.S. –S.I.U.

Incident Narrative“In the earlyafternoon of November 24, 2023, the SO and his partner, WO #1, together with WO #2, arrived at an apartment near Linkwood Lane, Toronto. A female resident of the apartment –the CW –had called 911 to report that her family member –the Complainant –wasacting up and she was concerned for her safety.The Complainant suffered from bipolar disorder and was experiencing a psychotic episode. He was angry and yelling at the CW, whom he had come to believe had installed spyware on his computer.The Complainant opened the door to the officers and watched as one of them –WO #2 –walked past him towards a bedroom in which the CW was located. The other two officers entered the apartment and from a position beside the doorway engaged the Complainantin conversation. The Complainant spoke about plans to hurt himself and others. After about ten minutes, the SO decided that the Complainant should be apprehended under the Mental Health Act.Advised that the officers would be taking him to hospital, the Complainant objected. He walked away from the officers in the direction of the kitchen. The SO grabbed his right arm and the Complainant pushed him away. WO #1 took hold of the Complainant from behind and forced him onto a sofa.In the course of the ensuing struggle, the Complainant kicked the SO in the head and managed to dispossess WO #2, who had returned from the bedroom, of his flashlight. The SO punched the Complainant’s face three times as the fight moved to the floor. He punched him again four times before the officers took control of his arms and handcuffed them behind the back.\f3Following his arrest, the Complainant was taken to hospital and diagnosed with a broken nose.”S.I.U. Analysis and Director’s Decision“The Complainant was seriously injuredduring his arrest by TPS officers on November 24, 2023. The SIU was notified of the incident and initiated an investigation naming the SO the subject official. The investigation is now concluded. On my assessment of the evidence, there are noreasonable grounds to believe that the SO committed a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s arrest and injury.Pursuant to section 25(1) of the Criminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the courseof their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.There is little doubt that the Complainant was subject to apprehension under section 17 of the Mental Health Act. Based on the information they had received of the 911 call and what they personally gathered having spoken to the Complainant in the apartment, the officers had reason to believe that he was a danger to himself and others because of mental disorder.I amalsosatisfied that theofficers and, in particular, the SO, used no more force than was necessary to take the Complainant into custody. Their approach was scaled and proportionate. The officers had attempted to secure the Complainant’s peaceful cooperation before resorting to force. Once the physical altercation was engaged, the Complainant proved a formidable challenge. The takedown by WO #1 was a reasonable tactic.By that time,the Complainant had pushed the SO and it was clear he would physically resist his arrest.Forcing him off his feet would better position the officers to deal with the struggle ahead. As for the punches, the first set of strikes by the SO occurred after the Complainant had kicked the officer in the head.In the circumstances, the officer was entitled to escalate his force to deter further assault by the Complainant. The second set of strikes occurred when the Complainant refused to release his arms to be handcuffed and assisted in bringing the struggle to an end.In the result, while I accept that the Complainant’s broken nose was the result of one or more of the punches delivered by the SO, I am not reasonably satisfied that the injury was attributableto unlawful conduct on the part of the officer. As such, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case. The file is closed”.Summary of the Toronto Police Service’s InvestigationThe P.R.S. –S.I.U.
